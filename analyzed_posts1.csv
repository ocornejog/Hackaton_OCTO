What country/culture ended up being way different than you anticipated?,26,1i3f8cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i3f8cp/what_countryculture_ended_up_being_way_different/,22,1737116802.0,"Just thinking back on how amazing my Poland trip was this past summer, and how much different the people were than I had anticipated. You always hear about the Polish face or how there’s little to no emotion, even my Polish friends here in the states joke about it. I also read a lot of history and it’s no secret that Poland has had a rough past… I imagined the Polish people were going to be a sort of hardened, stand offish type people. Like it was going to be hard to connect with anyone. Not unfriendly, maybe just… more hardened than other places in Europe. I honestly couldn’t have been more wrong. I met some of the most delightful people there, everyone I spoke to was extremely friendly and polite. It was the first place I ever had people get excited that I knew a few words of their language, which to hear about happening but I’d never experienced until Poland. I’d honestly say that the Polish are probably some of my favorite people in Europe.

"Colombia's Eje Cafetero and Bogotá -- the perfect trip, until it wasn't",74,1i38v19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i38v19/colombias_eje_cafetero_and_bogotá_the_perfect/,14,1737089799.0,"*TLDR - I fell in love with this country and its amazing people. On my last day I witnessed a shooting and did my best to stop the guy from bleeding out.*

I've been in Colombia for 18 days now. It's my first ever trip to this beautiful country and for the past few days I've been thinking about writing up all my wonderful experiences and sharing them here on Reddit, but something happened today and I'm going to share my unvarnished experience.

I decided to fly to Colombia at the last minute and bought my flights two days before departure. I found a lot of travel inspiration in this subreddit and others that made me decide that the Eje Cafetero was the trip I needed. But the flight deal I found took me to Bogotá.

I spent about a week in Bogotá and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The city was never high on my list, but I wanted to make the most of it. Of course, I was aware of the safety situation in the city, so I took many precautions: Planned my route if I was walking and mostly knew it by heart, Ubered at night, always kept my head on a swivel, all that kind of No Des Papaya stuff.

I spent my first few nights in a hotel near Parque El Virrey. It's a quiet area with plenty of good restaurants and places to walk to. I especially enjoyed my morning walks in the park and along the greenbelt that connects to Parque El Chicó. I had some great meals. And I liked the happening bar scene in Zona T / Zona Rosa.

Then I stayed a few nights at a wonderful Airbnb in Chapinero where the host cooked me a delicious lunch every day. My favorite was ajiaco. I rode the TransMilenio to La Candelaria. Great museums there. And I enjoyed wandering through all the streets and alleys around Plazoleta Chorro de Quevedo. I went to Monserrate and walked all the way up and down. I had a blast stopping at different vendors along the way for fresh fruit, chicha, coca tea. Anyways, you get it: the oft-maligned city of Bogotá has some nice things to offer and I was into it.

But the core of the trip was the Eje Cafetero. So I left Bogotá and I spent 10 days touring Jardín, Jericó, Filandia, and Salento. This is when I really fell in love with Colombia. The people were some of the warmest and most genuine that I've encountered in my travels. I would greet people as I walked around town and it would often turn into a short conversation. I met people that I wound up sharing meals with or hanging out with for an extended time. The landscapes are breathtaking. And also you can let your guard down a little in these areas. Generally, MUCH MUCH safer than a big city like Bogotá. I felt relaxed, tranquil and grateful to be visiting. Maybe one day I will write more about this part of the journey, but you get it: it's an awesome place and I was in travel heaven.

But all good things must come to an end and I arrived back in Bogotá in preparation for my flight home tomorrow. So, today was my last full day in Colombia. Just before 2pm in the afternoon I was walking in one of my favorite parts of Chapinero (east of Carrera 7 and north of Calle 53). An area with amazing restaurants, beautiful homes. . .basically a place that most people would call a ""nice"" neighborhood, and maybe even a ""safe"" neighborhood. 

I saw 2 guys on a motorbike coming my way. A common sight, but one that always puts me on high alert when I'm in Latin America. They passed by me and I kept on my way. And then POP POP POP. It didn't register as gunfire right away, but I spun around and I see the guy from the back of the motorbike with a gun in his hand and the guy he shot crumpling to the ground. By this point, I was in shock/disbelief but a woman near me started screaming and we both went over to the victim to help. I had my suitcase with me and took out a tshirt and applied pressure to the wound on his arm and in his midsection where he was bleeding out pretty fast. A big crowd amassed and after not too long an ambulance and a bunch of cops on motorcycles showed up. I have since read several news articles about the shooting and watched an interview with the victim's mother. He was very seriously injured and is in intensive care. While looking at media coverage I also saw myself on security camera footage that captured the shooting. It was all very disturbing and surreal since I've never had an experience like this. I do realize that violence happens all over the world and this is not just a Bogotá thing or a Colombia thing, but it's cast a shadow over this trip. In addition to feeling sad for the man who was shot I am sad that the many great people who live in Bogotá are dealing with this kind of insecurity. I read some of their posts on twitter and other places online reacting to this shooting and I can sense their immense frustration and anger with their leaders.",,,
Why is overland travel to French Guiana so expensive?,161,1i2ump9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2ump9/why_is_overland_travel_to_french_guiana_so/,45,1737049533.0,"I am traveling to Suriname next month and I was looking into a short tour (3 days or so) to French Guiana.

"4 days in Beautiful Baku, Azerbaijan ",2818,1i2bhm8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2bhm8,97,1736985039.0,"This is my first post in the community and I’m relatively new to Reddit. 

I wanted to share some pictures from my trip to Baku from last year. I live in the US and Azerbaijan is not really on anyone’s travel radar and I like to go to off the beaten path places if I can to avoid overtourism. 

In order these are the pictures: 
1. Baku City Seaside National Park - I stayed in a hotel along the park and while on a busy road I loved the park, lots of cafes places to sit beautifully landscaped with nice views of the skyline and the Caspian Sea. 
2. Buildings along the waterfront.
3. Historic buildings in the city center. 
4. Nizami street Baku’s main shopping street downtown. 
5. Same as above. 
6. Museum of Azerbaijan literature. Didn’t go in but did do the national carpet museum which is located in the waterfront park and it was excellent if you like the art of rugs from this region. 
7. Ismailiyya Palace / İsmailliyyə sarayı
8. Səadət Sarayı - used for weddings 
9. Baku City Hall
9. Baku Metro - Photography is prohibited but I was excited to be on a former Soviet metro system so I had to break the rules. 
10 - 11. Baku White City - a new massive development built as an extension of the urban core with modern and traditional architectural styles on former industrial land. The metro will be extend through the area. It has many shops, hotels, offices, and schools mixed in with the higher density housing. 
12. Port Baku, major shopping and office area. Lots of new investments are being made in the area in terms of parks and new streets to be more pedestrian friendly and enhance connectivity. 
13. Taken from Maiden Tower which is not pictured but this is the view of the old city with Flame Towers in the background. 
14. Heydar Aliyev Culture Center by Zaha Hadid. 
15. City view and park in front of Heydar Aliyev Center. 
16. Bibi Heyat Mosque 
17. Gobustan petroglyphs historic site. It was cool to see how this Neolithic society caught water and engraved carvings depicting their rituals into the rocks here and the view was great. 
18. Mud volcanoes. You can touch them as they erupt cold. They smell like gasoline and you can light them on fire. We drove out to them in old Soviet cars which was really unique. 
20. Shah Mosque in the historic city içerişehir. 

Overall I loved Baku it was very beautiful and clean, I wish I could have post more pictures and included the food I ate which was all very fresh and delicious. The city is a great contrast between new and old and it’s hard to place as it looks oddly Parisian or British in parts and then kind of like a Turkic Dubai in other areas. Everyone we encountered was very kind and it was one of the most warm countries I’ve visited. Flying over Azerbaijan the landscape in general is beautiful in the foothills of the Caucasus and would be worth exploring in depth if only I had more time. 

Happy to answer any questions about the trip but thanks for taking the time to view my post. ",,,

I am really not sure if I have skip Te Anau/Milford Sound or skip Tekapo instead. Just a disclaimer, we drove 6-7 hours multiple days in a row on roadtrip before with no issues. We are people of scenes and landscapes, not into beach and not planning to use a chopper.

"A very underexplored region! Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan",84,1i2pcmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2pcmr/a_very_underexplored_region_nakhchivan_azerbaijan/,23,1737035497.0,"Recently I visted Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan), the biggest landlocked exclave in the world!



Always wanted to visit it, as it seems to be on no-ones radar. Over the course of my 3 day trip I saw almost no tourists; a single family and one group of friends. The reason for it being that Nakhchivan has few connections to the outside, as the land borders are closed for nearly everyone and the airport mainly serves the capital.

The main highlight for sure is Alinja Castle (Qasili), high up in this mountainous region. And you can feel the the influences of the Middle East and the late Soviet Union, though very few speak Russian (and English even less so).

In general mid-to-cheap prices, but very little tourist infrastructure (that makes exploring it fun though). People are stoic but open to chat if you are able to communicate.

I have 3 weeks of vacation and I can start on November 12th and end on December 2nd to have some time off before I return to work. Or I can take time off later in November and return mid December. This would mean going to Austrailia first then NZ, and fly home from NZ which is looking like a 3-4 leg journey. Starting point being Edmonton International. 

The wedding is the last weekend of November. 

Based on my research so far it would be better to go to New Zealand first for 1.5 weeks, try to do a stay on both islands, then fly to Sydney for the wedding and a 1.5 week stay. (The less Jet Lag method).

I will have friends in Sydney but NZ will most likely be totally solo, which is fine. Im a LOTR nerd and ive wanted to go for a very very long time.

Flight prices are kind of crazy, initial research is around 3600 CAD one way for premium, (im 6'8"" so I need the legroom), which is almost as much as I spent for a round trip flight to Italy in October 2023.

- Some decent accomodation, a balcony with a sea view and a pool would be great
- Amenities within walking distance. Grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, bars etc. We're in our 40s and not going to party. We don't need specific 'foreigner' bars or anything and we'd choose safe and (relatively) quiet over loud and exciting 
- Easy to get around on foot or by public transport- direct links to Faro airport are preferred (we won't have a car).

I'm not sure if this is possible or not, but basically I'm looking for somewhere where for a few days we can chill out, stroll around some pleasant streets, relax on a balcony, have enough budget-friendly food options to either buy from supermarkets and have in the hotel or in local cafes, have a nice stroll in the evening and have a nightcap somewhere.

How does this look? Any recommendations? 

I would love to explore Italy but I know it will be extremely busy this year (2025) with the Catholic celebration and a bit of a hassle to get to since it’s on a peninsula. Also, I feel like there is so much to see in Italy, so it can be a trip of its own in the future.

What are some cities where touristy areas are located very near sketchy areas?,329,1i2asac,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2asac/what_are_some_cities_where_touristy_areas_are/,707,1736983054.0,"Self-explanatory title but basically, what are some cities where it's quite easy for an unsuspecting tourist to go from a tourist area and then accidentally wander into a sketchy neighbourhood?

Based on my experience, the first two cities that come to mind are San Francisco and Barcelona. In SF, it's very easy for tourists to go from popular places like Union Square, Civic Center, and Chinatown into areas like the Tenderloin, which has become an infamous neighbourhood in the city for all the wrong reasons. And in Barcelona, it's very easy for tourists to go from touristy zones like Montjuic, Poble-Sec, and La Rambla/Gothic Quarter and then unknowingly entering into El Raval which isn't exactly the nicest area in the city by any means.

On the flip side, cities like London, Paris and NYC are generally very safe for tourists as the sketchy zones in those three cities are often located in the outskirts of the city and very far away from the crowded tourist spots, hence making it pretty much impossible for an unsuspecting tourist to accidentally end up there.

What are some other cities you've been to where this is the case? I think this would be good to know for all tourists alike who are looking to visit new cities they aren't familiar with",,,

I had originally only been planning to be gone for 36-48 hours max. When I got there, I had decided to just eat the cost of the short-term parking lot due to convenience. 

But obviously, my schedule changed and my car will have been in the lot for over a week. I know at a minimum, I will have to pay a decent chunk of $$.

My question is: have I risked my car being towed and impounded by leaving it there this long? 

I can’t find any information online about being towed from short-term parking, but I’ve always used shuttle lots for any travel longer than 2 days, so I’ve never really had to worry about this. ",,,
Advice for April mountain treks & skiing in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh,2,1i35u8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i35u8d/advice_for_april_mountain_treks_skiing_in/,0,1737079843.0,"Hi Everyone, 

I’m a male solo traveler in my mid-20s, exploring North India in March & April, traveling by train and bus. My itinerary for March includes exploring Rajasthan and Utter Pradesh, ending in Vanerasi.

In Apri I will explore Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the order likely being Rishikesh > (maybe Shimla) > Manali > Dharamasala & Mcleod Ganj > Amritsar before a finishing in New Delhi. 

I’d like to do a 4-6 day mountain trek in Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh with the following criteria:

Most important is that the trek includes spectacular, breathtaking views with clear views of some huge mountains and crystal blue lakes.
Moderate difficulty
Availability for tours with food and tents provided, and the option to store my extra belongings at the base. 
Rhododendron blooms in April would be a bonus, but mountain views are my priority. 

From my research Spiti Valley, Kheerganga, Triund, Kedarkantha, and Har Ki Dun all could be options but would love to hear any advice anyone else has!

I’d also like to ask if there are any skiing areas in Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh that are still suitable in April, given it’s the end of the ski season? I love skiing and would be cool to do some on this trip if possible. Would Solang Valley or Auli work for me in April? 

Thank you all in advance! ",,,

I’m FINALLY going to Vietnam in April. The only thing I’m really confused about is planning the trip. We have 15 nights in total, and this is how it’s planned:

* Land at lunchtime in HCMC - 4 nights
* Da Nang - 5 nights (with 2 day trips to Hue and Hoi An)
* Hanoi - 2 nights
* Ninh Binh - 2 nights
* Hanoi - 2 nights (fly back home)

We don’t plan to take the train (prefer flights), and we’re not planning to do the Ha Giang Loop as it’s too mountainous for us. We’d prefer to focus on more city and beach vibes instead.

With Da Nang, we’re looking forward to some beach or pool time as well.

We chose Ninh Binh because we’ve heard better things about it compared to Ha Long Bay. However, my Vietnamese friend mentioned that Ha Long Bay is better. What would you suggest?

Since we’re each carrying a big trolley, we plan to keep our belongings in the hotel and do day trips instead of re-packing every two days. What do you all think about this plan?

We plan to go from Frankfurt to Amsterdam, then to Belgium (Bruges and Ghent), Berlin, and back to Frankfurt to catch our return flight.

Despite the tips to use trains, buses, or flights between cities, we intend to rent a car. Since we are four people, we believe that driving will make locomotion easier, more convenient for carrying our baggage, and maybe cheap. Additionally, we would like to stop in some cities during our road trip without being restricted by fixed arrival or departure times at the locations we plan to visit.

Given this information, is renting a car in Germany to travel to these other countries a good idea? For someone like me, who is accustomed to driving frequently in big cities in South America, is the driving experience in Europe similar? I understand there are some differences, but I’m already reading up on them.

Initially, I was considering renting an EV because I read that some places have low-emission zones, and I was unsure if a regular ICE (internal combustion engine) car would be allowed in these areas. However, after doing some research, I came across people recommending an ICE car for long-distance travel. They mentioned it might be more practical, especially since I’ve never used an EV before, and figuring out how to use charging stations could be challenging.  
Lastly, for someone who has never driven in Europe, considering the parking rules in each country, is it better to try parking in legal street spaces near points of interest in cities, or should I go directly to a paid parking lot?

  
Thank you very much for all the help.",,,

"Renting a car and open exploration between Medellin and Bogota, Colombia.",4,1i2tidf,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2tidf/renting_a_car_and_open_exploration_between/,3,1737046716.0,"One of the best trips my wife and I ever went on was an open plan trip around Georgia (the country) back in 2019. We booked our flights in and out of the country, a hotel for the first night we arrived, and a 4x4 rental for the rest of the trip.

We had a map with everything we'd like to see, and we just went with the flow. Our first stop was based on the weather on that first day. At the end of the day, about 4pm, we opened up a couple of booking apps, searched for locations within a short drive, and booked somewhere on the spot. If we liked a place we'd speak to the owners and ask to extend a night, and one time we left an area earlier than planned as we didn't vibe with it.

We're both from Europe, and we have lots of experience driving abroad. Whether it's crazy European cities like Athens or Tbilisi, or countries like Georgia where in the countryside you're lucky if there's tarmac. [This](https://i.imgur.com/IbqZWAR.jpeg) was our vehicle, and [this](https://i.imgur.com/XYayqL5.jpeg) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/LRmS2ZE.jpeg) are the type of roads we spent some time driving on. **My point being**, we are comfortable in both crazy traffic and in adverse driving conditions. In Georgia we drove the long way back from Ushguli, avoiding rerouting via Mestia; slow, arduous, offroad mountain trails.

We'd like to repeat the freedom this type of experience gave us, but this time in Colombia. 

We have flights into Medellin, and about 2 weeks later flights out of Bogota.

One option is to either use buses to travel between small towns and villages, exploring the countryside and coffee country, with most things prebooked based on public transport schedules, or to go with the flow with a rental car.

A couple of times over the last few weeks I've opened up the booking apps, searched for accommodation near a random village in the region we'll be in, and always found plenty of options.

Does anyone have experience with this? How did you find it? Is this a good idea? How likely are we to find accommodation on the day?",,,

I'm F/26, just looking for some general advice, personal stories, or tips and tricks (if any). I'm thinking about using SWAP, but it's pricey, so also wondering about doing it on my own.

**Does anyone have experience using SWAP, and did you find it useful? Pros or Cons?**

I find myself a bit worried that they recommend waiting until you arrive to both job hunt and find accommodation. My one other experience going abroad was doing an internship in South Africa, and my work and accommodation were figured out before I arrived.

What about the 8-Day or 4-Day Welcome Week? Is this worth it? The extra travelling? What about the access to the Whatsapp Group? Did this make it easier to connect with people? I am on the shyer side, meaning the prospect of having these things in place sounds like an advantage. But then again, I'm sure I will meet people anyway through work etc.

**Working Holiday on your own: Pros and Cons?**

The biggest pro is, of course, saving on cash. But did you find it made things more rewarding, more difficult? I went through a third party when doing an internship in South Africa, and there were times when I regretted it and wished I had gone out on my own.

**New Zealand or Australia?**

I know this comes down to preference at the end of the day, but just looking for insight anyway. I'm drawn to both places, though admittedly, Australia has been top of the list until just recently. I have people I can connect with in both places once I arrive too.

What is the job atmosphere like in both places? I have a Bachelor's degree in the arts, and my ideal would be to be hired on by a non-profit. But essentially, I am willing to find work doing whatever (barista, tourism, working with animals, etc. literally anything!)

What are the costs like? Living expenses? Is it easy to travel within the country?

US west coast national park - first time,3,1i2qc6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2qc6w/us_west_coast_national_park_first_time/,12,1737038355.0,"Hi, 

Together with my wife we're planning our vacation in the US. As our experience is non existent if it comes to this part of the world, I would highly appreciate any feedback, suggestion and any other tips which could be useful for us. 
The main goal for the trip is the  ""desert"" nature and national parks on the West Coast. 
Below is our very preliminary plan. 
If it comes to duration it will be min. 10 and max. 14 days, late April or early May depending on the flights schedule. 

We'll be travelling from Europe to LA. We plan to rent a car for a whole stay, something which will be relatively economical and comfortable enough for longer drives (RAV4 or similar?). 
 
We will stay a few days in LA to see some touristy spots and then move to Palm Springs (or somewhere nearby) to visit Joshua Tree National Park. From there, we will drive to Arizona. The main goal is to visit the Grand Canyon. We though about staying somewhere near Sedona and take day trips to Grand Canyon and nearby areas. After a few days, we will move to the south, visit Grand Canyon West and stay couple of days in Las Vegas, again doing some touristy activities. After that, the plan is to go back to LA via the Death Valley National and maybe visit Sequoia National Forest. Probably staying somewhere overnight (or even longer if it's worth it). Then, back to LA for another 1-2 nights and flight back to Europe.

So, that's a very preliminary plan, now a few questions.
1) First of all, is this doable? as per google maps, it will be around 1500 miles in total. Is it possible to do it comfortably or should we consider reducing/changing the plan?
2) Car rental. I have no experience in renting cars in the US. Firstly, I heard that only credit cards are accepted for the deposit even if I paid in advance, is this correct? Secondly, what about the insurance while travelling across different states? In my case that would be California, Arizona and Nevada. I would expect to have FDW which includes thefts as well. Is this a standard coverage in the US? Lastly, could you recommend any car rental companies? Heard some good words about AVIS in LA.
3) Safety in general. Despite ""difficult"" neighborhoods/districts in LA and LV should we expect any problems while travelling? What to look out for, what to avoid? Those long desert roads seem to be a little overwhelming. Also, we're not party animals and like to be in bed around 10 pm so definitely no late partying and travelling for us...

That would be it for now, if you have any locations/areas to visit or places to stay I would grateful for any recommendations. Thanks!",,,

I'm mainly wondering if it makes the most sense to find a lodge with everything included, or if it's possible to book a cheap stay and hire a local guide for 3/4 days to take us up and down the river, who will know the good places to look for animals. I'd be open to either, but have noticed a lot of the ecolodges charge absurd rates for their stays and I'm wondering if I cant book a cheap accomodation and hire a local for a few days. Saving myself money and knowing the money I do spend goes all to the guide appeals to me much more than these American tours available to book online.

We won't have any mobility issues, so I don't think we will be too bothered by the travel. Still curious on folks' thoughts though. I do think we have a train preference because of the comfort. I'd greatly appreciate your thoughts on the questions below.

1. Do you think this is the right order? With Paris as the start and end point, strangely it seems like this order, rather than Paris-Bordeaux-Cassis-Chamonix-Paris, is faster.   
2. Which option for Provence to Chamonix do you think makes the most sense?   
3. Despite not having children or mobility issues, do you think this is too much travel? If so, I'm wondering if the move would be to cut out Chamonix, which I would be really disappointed to do.   
4. What actually prompted me to post is finding out that what I thought was the perfect chateau in Bordeaux only has 2 (and not the necessary 3 we need) rooms with air conditioning and 1 without. This made me want to see if I could re-order things to accommodate the availability of that small chateau. Curious if folks have thoughts on whether no AC in July in Bordeaux is a deal-breaker.   
5. Would any short flights make sense? Looking at the math, it seems unlikely.

**Accommodation:** I'll be staying with friends (zero spending) in Valencia, Madrid, Barcelona, Interlaken and Zurich. In the other cities, I'll go to hostel or rent rooms/cheap apartments with 1 or 2 friends (cost will be split among 2 or 3 people)

**Budget:**

\- 1000 USD (round trip flight to Europe)

\- 5500 USD (accommodation; 100 x night in cities where I need to pay)

\- 8400 USD (daily expenditures, including meals, transport within a city, museums, etc; 100 x day)

\- 1000 USD (transportation between cities, flights, trains and buses)

= **TOTAL 15.900**

Not looking for luxury, so no expensive restaurants, I'll walk around the city most of the time, with the occasional coffee or bar someday. I'll keep it as budget friendly as possible.

Is this reasonable or shoud l readjust? Thank you in advance.",,,

The driver was not there when we agreed; he then kept saying he would be there in 5 minutes for over 40 minutes while my daughter was waiting.

As she was a minor, the booking was made especially so he could wait for her with a sign at the arrivals exit. Instead, he insisted that she come up to arrivals and get out of the terminal so he could pick her up.

At that point, I did not feel safe having my daughter wait any longer, and I asked her to take a yellow taxi.  


No, Transfeero is refusing to refund me for the pre-paid.

Feedback on 3 Weeks in Mexico Itinerary,1,1i2ukv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2ukv9/feedback_on_3_weeks_in_mexico_itinerary/,2,1737049404.0,"Hi there - my partner and I are planning to visit Mexico in the month of March. We will be there for 20 days, which hopefully gives us enough time to explore variety of things from culture, cities, surfing, and plus a tiny diving trip. This is our high-level itinerary so far:

**Days 1-5: Mexico City**

**Days 6-9: San Cristóbal de las Casas**

* We heard we can also do climbing/bouldering here?

**Days 10-13: Oaxaca City**	

**Days 14-17: Puerto Escondido**

* Including day trips to dive at Puerto Ángel

**Days 19/20: Back to Mexico City**

This is decent right? Leaving some room for little bit of improvisation.

My partner is actually staying longer for 5 weeks instead of the 3 weeks-ish. And he's into all of the outdoor stuffs, surfing, diving, climbing, hiking etc. So please do give some recommendations for him!

Paris tour options (4-5 hours max) vs self tour on 10 hour layover at CDG,1,1i2rtmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2rtmk/paris_tour_options_45_hours_max_vs_self_tour_on/,13,1737042385.0,"My husband and I are flying to Stockholm via CDG in March. We have a 10 hour layover at CDG. We booked this long layover on purpose hoping to give ourselves time to see at least the highlights in Paris. We are flying in on air france in business (also business class to Stockholm). We are traveling with 2 checked bags, which I assume will be checked through to Stockholm for us since it's all on the same ticket. We will have 2 backpacks (small) with us that we can just take with us into Paris on our tour. We'll be arriving on a Saturday morning into CDG.

Currently, we have a private tour booked with pickup at the airport but it's quite expensive. We're fine keeping that, but I was looking for other options. How hard is it to get from CDG to the heart of Paris by public transit/train if you've never done it before. We are pretty good at following directions, of course, but we don't speak French and we want to make sure we're back at the airport in plenty of time for our next flight. We'd like to just hit the highlights. Notre Dame, Eiffel, etc. 

I guess my question is how easy it is to navigate to the city and around the city and then back to the airport without a guide and see things on our own. We're relatively tech savvy, but with time being of the essence, we don't want to make a mistake that would cause us to miss our next flight. I'd love to be able to save that $400 for other activities in Sweden, but not at the expense of adding a ton of stress to our layover. Thanks!",,,

I’ve read a couple threads on here already. But I am hung up on which way to go. 
We have 9 days in Portugal coming up in April. Landing in Lisbon
My initial thought was to stay in Lisbon for three nights. With a Sintra day trip Head up to Porto for four nights. 
Some Douro Valley sights. 
And back to Lisbon the last night before flying home. 
What I’m struggling with is not spending more time in Sintra. I hear it’s amazing. 
Maybe we want to get a place there for a couple nights? Or just stay there with day trip into Lisbon? 
Idk. Any advice would be great. 
What I don’t want to do is rush around while we are there. 
I’m sure whatever happens will be amazing.

Edit: for clarity. We are a family of four. Two teenage boys 14 and 17. We enjoy nature but also want some historical sites. Really appreciate all the feedback. I’m thinking maybe we return to Sintra to spend our last night after the Porto visit.

"My trip to Cairo and Giza, which was deeply interesting, and during which I was only pestered a little",392,1i1ib6w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i1ib6w,15,1736893553.0,"This is a stream of consciousness, once proofread, about my first time to Cairo and Giza. I'm writing it on the airplane home.

I went in with low expectations, but rather liked the trip.

Day 1: Arrival, dinner, rooftop Pyramids

The view during landing was riveting, with the infinite desert on one side and a sprawling metropolis of repeating apartment complexes on the other.

I landed in the afternoon with no checked bags and cleared customs relatively quickly. I withdrew 5000 pounds (100 US dollars) from an ATM at a reasonable, government-regulated rate and headed to the taxi stand. The cash was mostly for tips and souvenirs, because the hotel, taxi, museums, and tours all accepted card. At the taxi stand a pre-arranged twenty-dollar taxi to the Pyramids On The Spot View hotel in Giza awaited me. An expensive ride in Cairo, I know, but a welcome comfort while getting settled in.

Upon my 17:30 arrival at the hotel I was greeted by enthusiastic staff who got me checked in and offered me a free rooftop guava juice. The rooftop had a panoramic view of the three major pyramids. I was offered a 1000-pound (20 USD) dinner on said rooftop and decided to take it. The view was otherworldly and the qofta and hummus were tasty. After dinner the manager came to have a chat with me and sold me a Nile boat cruise for 1750 pounds (35 USD) for the following evening. I didn't need a Pyramids tour because I had already booked one in advance.

Day 2: Pyramids, Museum, Nile

Early next morning I woke up to enjoy a complimentary breakfast on the rooftop, again taking in the Pyramids. Then I headed downstairs where my tour guide Lydia, a well-spoken young Egyptian, and her driver took me to the Pyramids to enjoy a camel ride, a view of the Sphinx, the Pyramids themselves, and the inside of the Great Pyramid. We were hassled a bit by people offering tours, camel rides, and trinkets, but Lydia's eyerolls and ""le, shukran"" (""no, thanks"") warded them off. There was also a tasty lunch with a panoramic view of the Pyramids. After lunch I was taken to various places where items like perfumes and papyrus were made, but did not buy anything there. The whole tour cost about 5000 pounds (100 USD) and felt quite worth it. The Pyramids really deserve their status as World Wonder. It is unfortunate how messy and full of camel poop the area around them is! But, the tour instilled me with confidence, and I felt ready to take on Cairo without local guidance.

After the tour I asked the driver to drop me off close to the Grand Egyptian Musem, which was nearby. They pulled over on the side of the highway, I tipped them 200 pounds each, and they showed me where to run across the highway to reach the museum. I guess that's just how we do in Egypt. The museum was 1200 pounds (24 USD), but absolutely worth it. It is a stunning building with exquisite artifacts on display. The big logo outside is written in both English and Japanese, which as a former resident of Tokyo I found interesting. I looked it up, and it turns out that the Japanese company JICA was involved with the construction of this 大エジプト博物館 (Grand Egyptian Museum.) Indeed, there were many Japanese visitors.

After the museum I took an Uber from the museum for 100 pounds including tip (yes, Uber is very much the way to go) and rested a bit before the boat cruise.

A bit before 19:00 a driver came by and took me downtown. The boat cruise was loads of fun. There was an elaborate buffet. A charming Egyptian man sang Latin American hits karaoke style and the audience got involved. Then, there was a belly dancer moving her muscles in impossible ways, and a man in a flashy spinning dress doing a different, but equally mesmerising dance. Both performances were set to Arabian music played by a live band. All the while I got to see the urban Nile at night, which was lovely.

After returning to the hotel I went for an evening stroll. I was asked by a bystander if I am Egyptian, which is weird because I am Polish and I think I look the part. They wanted me to go drinking with them, but that was a hard ""no"" given my unfamiliarity with Giza!

I strolled quite far, ending up at a peaceful convenience store where I could browse snacks unhassled. I asked the man behind the counter which chocolate is popular in Egypt and he pointed out Biskrem. I grabbed that, some water, and some mysterious cheese, all for 45 pounds (0.9 USD.) The cheese turned out to be high-salt sheep's cheese and was quite tasty. Biskrem turned out to be Turkish, but was also nice.

With that, I went back to the hotel and went to bed.

Day 3: Downtown Cairo

This was my last full day. I woke up late, checked out, and decided to try to go to the Pyramids again. I was hassled on the way, but armed with ""le, shukran"" I warded off almost everybody. A boy followed me the whole way to the ticket counter saying ""this way, this way, go"" even though I already knew where I was going. There was a bit of a queue and it was my last day, so I decided to abandon my little mission to the Pyramids l and go see downtown instead.

I grabbed my bags and ordered an Uber to my airport hotel, Le Méridien. This hotel was a little more pricy at 7500 pounds (150 USD) but I wanted to treat myself. Also, it was connected to my outbound terminal by a bridge. How cool is that? The Uber was 300 pounds; much less than the 1000-pound taxi I took in the other direction.

While I was checking in to Le Méridien the lady at the counter asked me what my plans were for the day. I told her I wanted to go see Cairotower, the other Egypt museum, and Khan El Khalily, which is a big market. She offered the hotel taxi services, and called the driver over. 45 USD. An unbelievable markup. Naturally I refused, but I did take her up on the next day's overpriced breakfast for 20 USD, because, as I said, I was treating myself. Then I got in my 6 USD Uber and went to Cairotower.

Cairotower was awesome. The ticket is 350 pounds (7 USD) and you wait about 45 minutes to get up, during which time you can enjoy a coffee on the carpeted floor at the rather atmospheric little cafe downstairs. The tower is nice to look at in a kitsch-Arabesque sort of way!

On top of the tower I had a glorious panoramic view of the city, including the now distant Pyramids fading into the smog. Highly recommended.

After the tower I walked over to the other, older, smaller museum, in which the head piece of Tutenkhamon, of ancient history textbook cover fame, can be seen (but not photographed!) This was another excellent museum, but after seeing the splendor of the new Grand Egypt Museum, the facilities themselves felt a little lacking.

From the museum I walked over to Downtown Cairo to snack on the famous Koshary Abu Tarek. The walk had significantly less hassling by street vendors. It just felt like normal city life, with some rather pretty buildings. I strongly recommend seeing this part of Cairo once you find your footing. The traffic is bonkers, but I felt safe there. And the koshary (a spicy tomato  pasta calorie bomb) hit the spot.

With a full belly, I went out to try to take an Uber to Khan El Khalily, but this turned out to be impossible. Traffic was peaking and no one wanted to pick me up. Even if I had gotten in, we would have been stuck in traffic. So I decided to hoof it for the 3.5 km to the market.

This walk I cannot recommend to everybody, but it was easily the most stimulating part of the trip. The kilometres-long, ten-metre-wide gap between the buildings and highway pillars was absolutely jam-packed with people, cars, and scooters, all somehow managing to flow together to the cacophonous soundtrack of horns and loudspeaker sales pitches. The merchants sold truly everything, from lightbulbs to juice to silicone sealant. For a couple kilometres I felt fully alert, taking in this absolute mess of daily life.

Eventually the air calmed and I felt that I was entering the Khan El Khalily market. There I found a different, quieter kind of chaos, with clothes, trinkets, and coffee sold against a beautifully colorful tapestry of textiles and lamps. I bee-lined for the upstairs market, where I knew there were stores with price tags that did not require negotiation. On the way there I noticed, again, many Japanese tourists, and I overhead someone from a shop yell ""Akemashite omedetou gozaimasu!"" which is a Japanese set phrase used to celebrate the new year. I smiled at the Egyptian man that said it, which startled him. He came over and asked me why I can understand Japanese, and it turned out he lived in Japan and was just in Cairo for the new year hanging out with his friends that run stalls in Khan El Khalily. It was a little bit surreal–a Polish-Canadian and an Egyptian chatting in Japanese in Cairo... After that unique experience I headed upstairs to buy a small hippopotamus figurine in peace. Then I headed far away from the market, to a main road, to catch an Uber and head to the airport hotel. I was tired and crashed pretty quickly.

Day 4: I suck, but Cairo Airport sucks more!

I woke up and looked at my wristwatch, which said 8:30. Uh oh. My flight was at 10:40. What had happened to my alarm? Ah, my phone had died because it wasn't properly plugged in. I plugged it into my portable battery and took a quick shower and packed. Once my phone was alive I checked my flight and it was not delayed. I was out the door by 8:50 and damned if I wasn't gonna eat my 20-dollar breakfast. I ran to the buffet, quickly gathered lots of items and scarfed them down with a coffee. At 9:10 I checked out and walked quickly across the bridge.

At the airport, the checkin counters were behind security, which I thought was weird, because that meant no liquids even in checked baggage... thankfully I had no liquids and nothing to check. I got through security and tried to get through passport control. No dice, ""go talk to EgyptAir and get a paper boarding pass."" I flagged down someone from EgyptAir and they said the electronic pass is fine, and to go to a different passport control counter, where supposedly the officer understands that. I went to that counter and still had to argue with the officer that the electronic pass is fine. The officer finally agreed, but said I needed a blue exit sheet. I went to go get it, and was handed a yellow exit sheet. I filled it in and brought it back to the officer, who finally stamped my passport and let me through. 9:40 now, one hour until departure. I felt confident that I could make it, but then... more security! A second, nearly identical security check. The line was moving really slowly, but half way through there was an agent that saw my boarding pass and waved me through. I finally arrived to my gate at 10:00 sharp. Not bad, an hour-and-a-half after waking up, but good grief what a bad airport. At the gate I commiserated with a fellow passenger from Mumbai, who had also nearly missed the flight.

My flight was of course slightly delayed, but this gave me time for souvenirs, coffee, and oral hygiene. When I queued up to board, I spotted Mumbai guy in the other queue and we exchanged a smile and a nod over our shared trauma.

What a messy airport. Get it together, Cairo.

But, the city itself was kind of amazing. There is a lot to see, and it is wildly different from daily Western life. The Pyramids are astounding and almost by default the highlight of the trip, but I found Downtown Cairo the most memorable. And yes, in Giza people do hassle you, especially near the Pyramids, but you can just say ""no"". Be rude. Yell if you have to. Screw them! You're there to have a good time.",,,

Stolen meds,3,1i2bys9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2bys9/stolen_meds/,3,1736986411.0,"I’ve done a fair amount of international travel, and for the past 10 years or so I’ve flown for volunteer home builds (think Habitat for Humanity and the like) 1-2 x year.  I still find myself thinking about an experience in Peru last September.

I’m old and take meds for blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.  I don’t take any opiates or other controlled medication.  For travel purposes I pour 1-2 weeks worth of meds into pill boxes for morning and night.  For this trip, we built south of Lima for the first week, then I and another volunteer flew to Cusco to do the tourist thing (Machu Picchu, etc).  That was amazing, as expected, and then we flew back to Lima and met up with other volunteers in Miraflores.  We checked into the hotel (Tierra Viva Miraflores Larco) in late afternoon.  Rooms were clean, beds made, etc.  I opened my suitcase, took out my hygiene kit for the shower, my iPad, and my pill box, leaving out meds for that night just to make it easy when I returned late after dinner.  iPad was out in the open on the bed.  Got up, took a.m. meds, had breakfast, went to the airport to go to Cusco.    

That night in Cusco I went to take evening meds and noticed that many doses of both a.m. and p.m. meds were missing.  They took entire a.m. and p.m. for some days, for other days they just took some of the pills, especially those that were large in size). iPad was untouched.  It definitely happened in Miraflores.  I hadn’t expected anyone else to be in the room that late in the day - there was no turning down of the bed or mints on the pillow.  

I was okay without the missing meds, and I tried to let the hotel know via email but service in Cusco was spotty at best.  I will definitely do things differently next time.

Driving situation in Amalfi Coast (Italy) region in February,0,1i2i6sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2i6sx/driving_situation_in_amalfi_coast_italy_region_in/,15,1737006365.0,"Hello,

My wife and I are planning on visiting Italy in **mid-February** and want to visit the **Amalfi Coast**. So, I was wondering what to do for transportation.

**We plan on taking the train from Rome to Naples**, and from Naples, we want to go to all the other places. We want to visit **Positano, Sorrento, Furore.** Our flight back is from the **Naples airport.**

A lot of TikTok videos and posts suggest it's very difficult to drive there. But we do want to visit a couple of places, so there will be a lot of back-and-forth.

So my question is

* should we rent a car? If so, how difficult is driving from one place to another? Its off-season but IDK if the weather is gonna play a factor. How is the traffic and parking situation? We are from Florida so its mainly flat land we are used to driving on.
* If not rent a car, is the public transportation good enough for us to move from place to place?
* Would Uber/Taxi be extremely pricey according to our itinerary?",,,

Cost breakdown of trip for two to Costa Rica (in USD),83,1i1omjn,https://i.redd.it/3etyfe6mv2de1.jpeg,53,1736912161.0,"We were there for 7 days/6 nights in June 2023 (and I forgot I made this chart until now).

Took direct flights from YYZ to LIR. We were mostly on the pacific side; hung out in Nicoya/Nosara, and spent a couple days at Arenal. 

From what I’ve been told, summer is cheaper as it’s rainy season. In June the rain wasn’t a problem at all. Yes, the roads were muddy and occasionally you need to cross roads that had temporarily become rivers (following a local helps). The rain was mostly at night, and honestly I find romance in falling asleep to the sound of raindrops hitting the roof. The added perk of going in the wet season is that everything is so lush and full of life. 

The hardest part was driving. The terrain is very, very rugged. The roads are steep, winding, and sometimes unpaved. It was especially hard at night, as outside the main areas there is no light - and it starts to get dark around 6-6:30. Renting an AWD is strongly advised. 

Some items that may cause confusion:
- parking is airport parking at YYZ, IIRC it was about CAD $90
- extra tips are tips paid in cash to tour guides and hotel housekeeping. Tips on meals were included in food. ",,,
Should I just go on this trip or skip it? (Pakistan),4,1i247b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i247b8/should_i_just_go_on_this_trip_or_skip_it_pakistan/,15,1736965943.0,"

Alright, so my college planned a trip to this snowy place, and I’ve been waiting two years for this. I was super excited, but all my friends ditched at the last minute. Now I’m stuck deciding if I should go alone. I don’t really know the other people going, and with around 60 people, I feel like I might just end up standing there awkwardly with no one to talk to.

The trip costs about 9% of my monthly income, which isn’t a big deal for me, so money’s not the problem. It’s just a one-night stay, and I’m excited to see the place, but I’m not sure how I’ll feel without any close friends around.

The trip places are Faisal Mosque, Patriyata, Mall Road, Nathia Gali, Donga Galli and Lake View Park. They’re charging 9k PKR for the trip, and I think the total will cost around 13k PKR for everything. There’s only the ski chairlift (or whatever it's called) there, but I’m excited because it’s been over 4 years since I traveled anywhere. The views look beautiful, and I’m really looking forward to it, but I’ve never been to a snowy area or done anything like this before, so I’m not sure what to expect.

My family is planning a trip later this year to a nearby historical city, and there’s about a 30/70 chance we might also visit this snowy area during that trip. So, there’s no guarantee I’ll get to go with them either.

For context, I’ve only been on one proper trip before (don’t remember much of the other one because I was super young), so I’m not sure if I’ll enjoy this alone.

Would you guys take the leap and just go? Or skip it and wait for the family trip, even if it’s uncertain? What would you do?",,,

Ryanair Damaged Baggage - do I go to ADR?,2,1i20wap,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i20wap/ryanair_damaged_baggage_do_i_go_to_adr/,11,1736957552.0,"  
Hi everyone, just wanted to ask for some advice since I'm facing a bit of a conundrum.

  
Returned to the UK with Ryanair in Late Dec with one checked in baggage. When collecting it at the belt, I noticed a 5cm+ hole in the corner of my hard suitcase, some scratches, and my metal name tag completely bent out of shape and broken. You could see through the inside mesh into the suitcase so it was no longer weather proof and the shell started to crack since it was no longer reinforced by the corner piece. Thankfully the zip and lock was fine so no lost belongings etc. while going home but the integrity of it is gone, so wouldn't survive another day out.

  
Took pictures, went to the desk (thank god someone was there!), got my PIR, submitted it, all good. The suitcase was about 1 year old, and bought from an international (ish) brand in HK (in person), no receipt/card statement as it was a gift, originally paid for in HKD, and the model was discontinued for a newer version of the same type under another suitcase name.

Cost of suitcase was about £330\~, of course I told them exact price in HKD and the GBP equivalent.

Got my response - €50 compensation. While I didn't expect much from Ryanair, it's insulting since that amount won't cover even 1/3rd of getting the same (type of) suitcase, and it sounds like they just want me to go away instead of actually wanting to compensate me for their mistake.



Is there any merit in emailing them back? They said this is their final settlement. Do any of you know if Ryanair has a compensation 'cap' for baggage without a receipt?

And/or should I go to ADR/ODR? I was hoping for something closer to £100 to go towards a new one from the same brand.  
Also, if I go to ADR/ODR, do you any of you have experience with this + tips on what would happen if I do?

  
Would appreciate any input - thanks!",,,

Until then, I've had nothing to complain about. People are so so friendly and helpful. 

Unfortunately, I was struck by an awful tourist scam. I was approached by a well dressed man who pretended to like my country and all, and started advising me on where to shop. Somehow, an empty tuk-tuk was waiting beside him, and he advised him to take me to that shop. 

It was a gems shop, and I was ripped off. I most probably bought a fake gemstone for my mom. There was absolutely no info about the shop on Google, and then, I came across similar stories online. 


I went back to the shop after reading a few TripAdvisor scams, but I could do little. I didn't have time to go to the cops. Thankfully, it was $100 (still huge for me, nearly what I paid for 5 nights in an AirBnB) and I've had to let go. 

I literally save up my salary for travels, and something like this makes me incredibly sad. Almost trying hard not to break down at the airport.

I booked a vehicle at [costco.com](http://costco.com) on Dec 6, for total of US$207.84 and picked up the vehicle on Dec 31st afternoon at LAX location. I was told to pick a vehicle at the assigned parking row and a service guy there told us to pick any car from the three that were the same size.

I returned the vehicle on Jan 4 and noticed that the total amount charged to my credit card was US$1174.05, almost 6 times of the original amount. I talked to the on-site manager, DJ, immediately. He said the vehicle I drove was a standard SUV, not mid-size SUV as I booked. Therefore the software automatically charged me more than the original amount. I said I just took the vehicle whatever your staff gave to me and how I was supposed to know it was not the right size. He gave me a refund of US$966.21 and showed me the amount on screen. He said he was unable to print out the receipt so he let me took the screen capture. He mentioned that the refund should show on my credit card in one or two days.

Next day, Jan 5, I checked my credit card transactions online. The refund of US$966.21 did show up. However, in the evening of Jan 5. Alamo charged me US$966.21 to my card. Alamo took the refund back.

I called Alamo office next morning. The lady who answered my call said someone would take a look at this issue and give me a call back. I waited until Jan 7 around lunch time and nobody called me so I called them again. A guy answered my call and said he would send a message to the local manager.

A few hours later, I got an email from Alamo with an invoice of US$970.00. At the same time, a refund of US$966.21 showed up on my credit card. I got totally confused and was worried about this new invoice so I called Alamo again next morning. A lady answered my call and said I was not owning anything and just ignore the invoice. I asked her send me an email indicating the latest invoice was void. She said she would do it, but I haven’t got it yet.

I thought it was the end of the story, but I was wrong. In the evening of Jan 9, Alamo charged my credit card for US$970.00, again.

Where’s the justice?",39,1i1iojb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i1iojb/ive_lost_over_1000_from_qatar_airways_misleading/,88,1736894512.0,"Along with so many QR nightmares I’ve read about, I’m dealing with a situation with Qatar airways that lets me feel **cheated**.

Here’s what happens, when you book an economy flight online, the details show that you’re allowed one free flight change. QR gets away with it because technically you are not charged for any flight change fees, but to get the change made, you’re still going to have to **pay exorbitantly high costs in what they call “fare difference” costs.** In my case, I need to pay $1,600 to make the flight change. Why do I consider this to be cheating? Because ***does it make sense, that a brand new ticket costs $1,700, while my fare difference cost is $1,600?*** In essence, my options are:

**option A** \- Pay the fare difference to change my flight date (Cost $1,600 USD)

**option B** \- Forgo my ticket and buy a brand new ticket from QR for that flight date (Cost $1,700 USD)

From this perspective you can see, **my flight change is literally just me buying a brand new ticket, with a mere $100 credit.**

At the moment, my best option is **option C** which is to literally forgo my ticket and request a refund (and be at their mercy if they’ll ever give anything back, as others reported, they don't...) and buy a brand new ticket from another airline (in this case Cathay Pacific) which will cost $500 less than option B.

Now, I’m reaching out to everyone here because of the countless instances of QR cheating people (Not answering emails, not providing refunds, not reimbursing for losses, etc.) I don’t think my continuous efforts to reach out to them to get a fair outcome will be fruitful. So my question is, **has anyone been able to succeed in fighting an unfairness and obtaining a favorable outcome from Qatar Airways?** 

UPDATE: The reschedule is for the **same fare class**.

Where to spend last night in Italy near Malpensa and last afternoon on the drive back from Dolomites,1,1i24g1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i24g1r/where_to_spend_last_night_in_italy_near_malpensa/,4,1736966567.0,"Hi everyone. I'm going to Italy in a few days for two weeks and I'm a bit hung up on where to spend the last night. It will likely be our last night in Italy for the foreseeable future, so I feel like I'm putting a lot of pressure on the decision. 

We will have a car and will be driving 4 hours from the Dolomites that day. My wife is getting a small tattoo at 8am in the Dolomites before we leave, so it's not like we'll have much time that day to explore wherever we end up. 

I've debated stopping somewhere on the way to explore for a few hours, like Merano or Riva del Garda, or driving straight to Como (town) or Varese and exploring one of those places a little. 

I wouldn't mind seeing one of the big lakes since we haven't seen any in our previous trips. Maybe we can use the car and spot at some cool viewpoints or places along Lake Garda or Lake Como.

.Can someone please help recommend something so we can make the most out of our last afternoon in Italy?",,,

Based on the research I've done, I've narrowed it down to Tromsø (Norway), Fairbanks (Alaska), Iceland, or Finland. I'm not sure which exactly to go with, as I've heard pros/cons regarding each place. I would also like to be able to stargaze at the same time, so I'm not sure if this would help me narrow down which place to go with. 

Does anyone have any experience seeing the lights in these locations around this time of year or just anywhere in general? I'm open to all recommendations/insight, and finances aren't an issue.

Seeking Advice: Northern Bali Trip with Senior Citizens and Family in April 2025,4,1i1ueny,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i1ueny/seeking_advice_northern_bali_trip_with_senior/,7,1736936181.0,"Hi everyone,

For mid-April 2025, I’m planning and gifting a Bali trip for a group of 8 people, including 3 senior citizens (73, 68, 67) plus a 2-yr old baby. We’ll be staying for about 7 days and 6 nights to celebrate the birthdays of my mom, my mother-in-law and my brother. For the senior citizens, it is the first time overseas. We are from India.

I’ve been to Bali twice before (pre-COVID), mostly staying in Ubud, Canggu, and Sanur. I know Sanur is great for senior citizens, due to flat beaches, walkway and a lot of restaurants and Ubud is unique, so I was planning to split the trip in these two places. We are exploring villas to accommodate us.

But before I book anything, I’m considering the northern part of Bali this time. I have never stayed in Northern Bali. I have found a few villas between Lovina beach and Kubutambahan.

I had a few questions –

1.       Is northern Bali comfortable for senior citizens who aren’t very adventurous and just want to relax?

2.       How is the availability of restaurants and grocery stores in around that area.

3.       Is safety any concern in this area?

4.       Any waterfalls around this area which are flat and walkable or just have a viewpoint?

If I choose north, I may skip Sanur and most of southern Bali. But I am wondering if it is my previous visits which is making me biased or should I still to Ubud and Sanur for a more ‘conventional’ Bali trip.",,,

No Seats Available Together Flying Internationally with Toddler,0,1i2c7bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2c7bz/no_seats_available_together_flying/,27,1736987100.0,"Wondering if anyone has ever had an issue not being seated next to their child on an international flight?

For context, we (two parents, one infant on lap and one three-year-old toddler) are flying on Iberia to Spain in March.  We are in premium economy, however, when I booked, it would only let myself (with the infant in lap) choose a seat without paying. There was many available seats, so I wasn’t too worried about choosing a seat later. Now, when I checked the airline website (two months before the flight mind you), it seems there is a different configuration of the plane and less seats in premium economy. There are now no seats together available for my husband or three-year-old son to choose.  I called Iberia and they recommended waiting until I get to the airport on the day of the flight, but this certainly makes me nervous.

Has anyone had this issue come up before and been in a situation where they were not seated next to their child ?

I certainly don’t want to be  “those people” on the flight, demanding that someone move and at this point and absolutely willing to pay the extra money to pre-choose seats for my son and my husband, if there were any available together - which there are not. But again, he’s three- he has to sit next to my husband or I. 

Any advice?


UPDATE: two seats across the aisle from each other opened up so I grabbed them. Thanks to the people with helpful advice!!",,,

We both love adventure, nature, exploring, but also big cities cultural and creative life. We are very active but we don't want to be jumping from place to place everyday. We LOVE walking around, hiking, snorkel and good food.

Also it's important to notice we've never been to the Caribbean or SEA.

We've tried to put together and itinerary that includes mountains, jungle, beach and city. We've also considered other options like Pacific area, Capurgana, Amazonas, Tayrona and Medellin, but we were not able to make a proper plan.

This is the itinerary:

1 - Eje cafetero - Arrive to Pereira around 12h (jetlagged) and pick up rental car

2 - Eje cafetero - Trek in Cocora Valley

3 - Eje cafetero - Visit towns and coffee farm

4 - Eje cafetero - Visit thermal waters and waterfall

5 - Santa Marta - Fly to Santa Marta and explore the city 

6 - Lost City Trek\* - day 1

7 - Lost City Trek - day 2

8 - Lost City Trek - day 3

9 - Lost City Trek - day 4 and sleep in Santa Marta/Minca

10 - Minca + sleep in Minca

11 - Morning in Minca and travel to Barranquilla (sleep in Barranquilla) 

12 - Providencia - Fly to Providencia (arrive around 12h) and chill around the island

13 - Providencia - Scuba day + some exploring

14 - Providencia - Snorkel + kayak

15 - Providencia - Island visit 

16 - Bogota - Fly to Bogota in the morning

17 - Bogota and fly back at 23h

\*We've read many mixed opinions about this trek, but we've read experiences from Spanish speaking people and they seemed very happy about it. We've also considered a multi-day tour in Amazonas, and a trip to Gorgona Island, but they. seemed too difficult to fit in the trip.

If you have any suggestions about the itinerary, or some ideas about places that are a must, please let me know!

Some factors to consider are that my parents are almost in their 60s and they kind of like your stereotypical Asian parents (dad is from Hong Kong, mum is Singaporean). They wouldn't want a tour that is too adventurous, and they could complain/get cranky about a slight change in the itinerary.  
  
My dad's health isn't the greatest, he recently recovered from lung cancer, so I'd like to book a tour that doesn't have too much walking, but also a lot of sightseeing and such.

So, I'd like to ask those who have been on more ""chill"" tours with G Adventures,

1. How did you feel about the tours? Was everything generally smooth? Or were there many hiccups?

2. If you were in my shoes, would your parents enjoy a trip like this?

Hope that someone can advise me on this matter because I'd like to do something for them as well. Thank you!",,,

This is my second time flying to Europe, and first time in the south of France. My bf and I are travelling for a wedding. I’m debating between these two flight paths for outbound/return including layovers however I’m a bit stumped. 

The cost isn’t the biggest factor to me, more so the level of comfort/service as this will be a kind of intense trip and I’d like to remove as much stress from flying as possible. 

        OPTION A 
DEPART: 13h 30m
6:40pm YVR-MUC — AC9432 Airbus 350-900
[2h 15m layover]

Day 1 - Lima: 
- Arrive in Lima after an overnight flight from Canada 930am on a Saturday. Get to hotel in Miraflores by lunch time, explore Lima for the day.

Day 2 - Paracas/Huacachina
- Day tour booked through Peru Hop to Paracas and Huacachina. Long day leaves around 5:30am and back ~11:30pm. Tour will drop off at Wyndham hotel at Lima airport for flight to Cusco next day.

Day 3: Lima to Urubamba
- Fly to Cusco. Flight not booked yet but plan to arrive by noon. To acclimatize better, we are going straight to Urubamba to stay at Tambo Del Inka. Question for this day - we were thinking about doing a stop in Chinchero or maybe Moray / Maras salt mines on the way to our hotel in the Sacred Valley. Is this reasonable, it seems like these stops could be pretty quick? Or too much for first day? If we did do this, what would be the best way to organize this, private driver?

Day 4: Sacred Valley
- Either do Moray/Maras salt mines in AM and Ollantaytambo in PM, or if we did some sights the previous day then relax in AM and visit Ollantaytambo in PM. Back to Urubamba for the night.
- Suggestions for tours run out of Urubamba or Ollantaytambo? Most seem to run to and from Cusco. Just want to figure out the easiest way to see all the sites.

Day 5: Machu Picchu
- Get early train, do tour (I’m thinking circuit 2A), explore Aguas Calientes then get train back to Ollantaytambo and stay at Urubamba hotel for another night
- Considered staying a night before or after in AC but it feels doable to do Machu Picchu in a day trip as we won’t be doing Huayna Picchu, and I’m leaning towards the idea of our hotel in Urubamba being a bit of a home base.
- Anyone have any suggestions for tour groups that run day trips to Machu Picchu from Urubamba or Ollantaytambo? The hotel offers it but quite expensive.

Day 6: Urubamba to Cusco
- Check out of hotel and make our way back to Cusco, thinking it may be worth stopping in Pisac ruins and market on the way back. Explore Cusco in evening

Day 7: Cusco
- Explore Cusco

Day 8: Fly home

Currently sticking to mainly Portugal with some brief time in Barcelona this March. 
How does this look so far?

My main uncertainty currently is the 12th/13th, hoping to include Coimbra and sacrificing a little time in Porto/Lisbon to do so. 
There are so many amazing sites to consider and it's been difficult saying no to things (such as Madeira Island).

Land in Barcelona 1pm Saturday March 8th.
8th: Mercado, Tapas, Gothic Quarter/Gaudi Cathedral

9th: 1/2 day trip to Montesserat, Gothic Quarter/Gaudi
we aren't inclined to go to museums or buy tourist sight-seeing tickets etc. just happy to be in the city, walk around, see beautiful things and eat good food.


Land in Porto 2pm Monday March 10th.
(wanting to be in Porto during the week, hoping it's less touristy than the late week/weekend?)
10th: settle in, walk along the river front, Livraria Lello if possible, Sunset view, Pastel de Nata + dinner

11th: Duoro Valley (I don't drink alcohol however would still like to see!)

12th: Livraria Lello if missed, head to Coimbra to see the University Library (thermal baths if possible)Stay in Coimbra? Porto? Head to Lisbon after?


13th: Depart from Porto or Coimbra to Lisbon if not there already. Check out LX Factory, viewpoint or walk around, dinner

14th: Sintra: not intersted in going into Pena Palace but wouldn't mind the beautiful hike up there, I heard the Moorish castles are very nice to see
Happy to skip/see Pena Palace from a distance and head to other spots

15th: Alfama neighborhood, check various viewpoints, dinner, evening jazz

16th: head back to Barcelona, relax, beach? gift shopping, dinner before flight

17th: flight at 11:30am from Barcelona to the States


EDIT: to add that we are doing Barcelona because we booked flights in/out of Barcelona. It wasn’t thought out well because going was an impulse decision to begin with (not sure if you’re interested to know that long story). 
One of the people traveling in our group has a lifelong wish of going to Lisbon and it gradually turned into a Portugal trip from that point. 
So yes, in hindsight, it would have been wiser to fly in/out of Portugal however the flights are non-refundable. It’s an inconvenient situation but I’d like to make the most of it. Thank you all for reading/responding ",,,

Borneo - Kuching,0,1i1gxud,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i1gxud/borneo_kuching/,6,1736890031.0,"We live nearby (relatively) and flights are cheap, and I'm trying to figure out how many days is sufficient for us. Info about us as travellers:

\- mainly interested in the orangutan sanctuary, so a visit there for 2-3 hours or however long is recommended

\- interested in the cat culture stuff there, such as a cafe or museum, probably just 1-2 hours

\- neither of us are hikers/trekkers. Gentle walking is fine

\- I can't tolerate the sun well; partner can't swim - we find beach holidays fine for an hour and then get bored

\- we have traveled extensively already in our lives and don't need or want ""thrill"" type experiences

Wondering if 2 full days is sufficient; again, flights are super cheap and only 90 minutes for us, so we view it as a little fun trip, not something we'd need to plan a whole week for. Thanks!",,,

We are piggybacking off a factory tour that his work sponsors outside Venice so we'll do a few days in Venice but we're both of German descent and he's never been so we're going to hop over the Dolomites via train and explore Bavaria.  I was in Munich about 5 years ago and was a bit disappointed but we had just left Dresden where we had explored the area and it was a little too much ""city"" for me.  But he wants to see Munich, naturally, and also tour the BMW factory.  Otherwise I want to focus on smaller towns, quaint and scenic.  Here is my tentative itinerary and I would love to get your feedback.  

Day 1 - Train from Verona to Innsbruck through the Brenner pass - stay the night in Innsbruck

Day 2 - Train from Innsbruck to Garmisch-Partinkirchen - rent a car.  Explore GP and drive to Oberammergau.  This will be our base for 3 nights.

Day 3 - Explore Oberammergau

Day 4 - Drive to Fussen, see the castles

Day 5 - Leave GP, stop in Bad Tolz along the drive to Munich

Day 6 - Explore Munich

Day 7 - BMW factory, maybe Dachau?

Day 8 - return car, head home

  
A few questions - am I missing something special?  Should we hit the BMW factory on the way in to Munich and return the car before we stay in Munich?  I hear having a car in Munich is more of a hinderance.

Mountain West USA 3 week road trip itinerary,0,1i1f28i,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i1f28i/mountain_west_usa_3_week_road_trip_itinerary/,11,1736884990.0,"Hi all!

I'm from Belgium and have previously done a road trip in South-West USA (the typical SF, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Las Vegas, Zion, Bryce, Moab) and the Rockies in Canada. I loved these so much that my girlfriend and I would like to do our honeymoon in the USA, with a road trip through the ""Mountain West"" states. This would be in july and august 2025, with camping. We much prefer nature sightseeing and hiking. I don't do great in the heat, hence most of our itinerary is focused on some less hot areas. I'm looking for some feedback on our ideas!

Our current plan is flying into Denver, and exploring the Rocky Mountains NP. Afterwards we'd move towards Moab, and perhaps add the Arches and/or Canyonlands and/or Capitol Reef NP (I'm aware it gets hotter here). This Utah part is the only part I've already visited but it is somewhat in our planned direction. Afterwards we'd continue north to Grand Teton and Yellowstone NP.

Afterwards I'm unsure yet.

Option 1:  
Up north you have the Glacier NP, which looks and amazing. We already did Banff and Jasper in Canada, and we loved it quite a lot. We'd probably fly out of Kalispell back to Belgium.  
The flights and one-way rental car are however a little more expensive.  
Edit: is continuing to Washington (Mount Rainier, etc.) and flying back from Seattle too far?

Option 2:  
We could continue east to the Black Hills and Badlands in South Dakota, and loop back to Denver. Those NP seem nice too, but I'm afraid it's quite some driving without a whole lot special between Yellowstone - South Dakota, and South Dakota - Denver.  
The roundtrip flight in Denver and roundtrip rental car is however a bit cheaper.

If you would have an additional option, or other feedback please feel free to share. Thank you so much",,,
Help with 7 day Yucatan travel itinerary,0,1i1eyxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i1eyxc/help_with_7_day_yucatan_travel_itinerary/,1,1736884782.0,"Long story short, my SO and I ended up booking a short stay in Yucatan at a very short notice; we travel in exactly week's time. Neither of us have been to Mexico, and we'd like you good folks' help in figuring out a good itinerary.

Here are some key details.

* We fly in and out of Cancun.
* Excluding fly in and out dates, we have exactly 7 days to spend there. 
   * Inbound flight arrives around 10 PM, so we'd probably want to stay the night in Cancun.
   * Outbound flight is 5PM, so we have most of the day 8 to get to the airport from wherever we'd be.
* The only must-do thing in our list is visit Chichén Itzá.
* We prefer a mostly laid back holiday, and don't want to pack our days with too many things. We'd be happy visiting a couple of places, having some good Mexican food, and just relaxing around.
* Checking out recommendations on the Internet, Merida and Tulum seem to be the top two places, but looking at the map and our stay, it seems like we can (or want to) do only one of the two.
* We prefer not to rent a car, so public transportation would be ideal.



Given all that what would be a good itinerary?

* Should we go directly from Cancun to either Merida or Tulum, see stuff around, and visit Chichén Itzá from there on one of the days?
* Or first stop at Chichén Itzá on our way to either place?
* Between the two, which would you recommend?
* Best transport options - buses or train, and in what order?

I expect we'll aim for a few days in Mumbai, then train to Goa for 3-4 days somewhere (what's Arambol like these days?), then down to Kerala by train maybe to Varkala, or a similar beach/beaches, before some kind of Kerala backwater exploring and maybe a national.park or tea plantation more inland.

I like the look of the Andaman islands, and appreciate that this will involve flights (Bangalore?), permits, ferries, etc. Anyone been there? I'm thinking about getting g the ferry from Port Blair to Little Andaman and spending a week there.

My fiancé and I are planning our honeymoon for this year and originally decided on a European destination, like Portugal. 

However, after researching we weren’t blown away by what we saw and instead switched over to thinking about Japan. 

We get married May 31 and heard that the summers in Japan are almost unbearable. So we decided to go at the beginning of October. 

Now, all I read about it typhoons and hurricanes and all sorts of craziness in Japan at that time. 

Is October a bad time to go to Japan? Is Japan not a great spot for a honeymoon? 

I generally am just curious as to what people think about Japan and vacationing there on a honeymoon and the timing of the vacation.

I’ll go to Paris via road and it’s going to be an exhausting car ride for sure. I don’t really have other options since I’m flying with a dog and no airlines close to my location accepted him because of his breed. The journey to Paris will take roughly 16 hours. 

I’ll arrive by midnight - I couldn’t arrange a later transfer, since my options were limited with a dog.

My check-in opens at 8AM, so I thought I’ll just spend that 8 hrs in the departure hall, watching movies etc. 
Recently I’ve read that the airport closes for the night, and security might ask me to leave the building until 4:30AM. I’ll have 3 bags and a large kennel with me, I am moving back home to another country and again this was my only option to take my dog, and there’s no way I’m going anywhere without him, haha.

I’m not sure if anyone has an experience with staying at the departure hall for overnight, is it really that bad or is it likely that they’ll ask me to leave? 
I am thinking of booking a room in ibis (it’s the closest to the terminal, basically a short walking distance) but $130 for a few hours seems a bit unreasonable. 

TL;DR: I'm driving to Paris with my dog since no nearby airlines allow snub-nosed breeds. I’ll arrive at midnight and need to wait until 8AM for check-in, but I heard the airport might close overnight. Anyone know if they’ll make me leave? Considering an ibis hotel, but $130 seems too much for a few hours.

🇻🇳 Vietnam: 17d itinerary updated. Any suggestions? ,0,1i19gie,https://i.redd.it/dd1ey62ygzce1.jpeg,3,1736870908.0,"Hello fellow travelers! 😊

I'm here for the second time to ask for your help, after reading all your valuable comments under my previous post where I was asking for information about an itinerary in Vietnam. Thanks to you, I’ve updated my plan and now I’d like to share the revised version to get more suggestions and feedback.

**Background**  
- My arrival and departure are fixed in Hanoi (arriving the morning of March 7, departing the morning of March 24; the 23rd will be my last full day).  
- I’m passionate about photography and videomaking, so I prefer rural villages, traditional people, and daily life.  
- I’m not a fan of city hustle, but I love small alleys with street food and authentic atmosphere.  
- My main goal is to reach Hoi An for the Lantern Festival.  

**Updated Itinerary** 

7: Arrive in Hanoi. Bus to Ha Long (about 3 hours).  
8: Ha Long Bay cruise. Evening bus to Ninh Bình.  
9: Ninh Bình.  
10: Ninh Bình.  
11: Ninh Bình. Night bus (14 hours) to Hoi An.  
12: Hoi An or surroundings.  
13: Hoi An (Lantern Festival in the evening).  
14: Hoi An or surroundings.  
15: Hoi An or surroundings.  
Night bus to Sapa (22 hours).  
16: Sapa (arrival).  
17: Sapa.  
18: Sapa (last day). Bus to Ha Giang (6 hours).  
19: Ha Giang (arrival at night or in the morning, explore the surroundings).  
20: Ha Giang.  
21: Ha Giang.  
22: Ha Giang (last day). Night bus (8 hours) to Hanoi.  
23: Hanoi (final day, preparations for the flight).

**Questions**  

1. Are 4 days in Ha Giang too much? I’m not sure if I can rent a scooter (I don’t have a motorcycle license), so I’m unsure how to get around. Do you have any suggestions for activities to do?  
2. Are 4 days in Hoi An and the surrounding area too many? I’ve seen there’s a lot to see around (Hue, Da Nang, Mỹ Sơn), do you have any recommendations for what to visit nearby?  
3. Is the night bus from Hoi An to Sapa (22 hours) doable, or would it be better to break the journey into stages and stop in other places before getting to Sapa? (reducing the stay in Sapa or Ha Giang)  
4. Is just one day in Hanoi enough? I don’t know what to do in Hanoi based on my preferences. If I only had one day, what would you recommend not to miss, considering I prefer cultural and authentic parts of the city?  
5. What is the best way to travel between the rural villages of Ha Giang and Sapa? Is there a good public transport system, or is it better to rent a scooter or take a private taxi?

If you have any other suggestions or tips, they would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much in advance! Hugs. 🥰

* Drive to Dambulla (stay 3 days) - seeing the cultural triangle 
* Drive to Kandy (3 days) - tea country, trains
* Train to Yala NP (3 days) - national park and seeing wildlife, any specific safari recommendations would be great
* Drive to Galle (4 days), be beached base 
* Back to Colombo and fly back

Would any of the time weightings be seen as too rushed? We would look to hire a private driver as reommended. 

Additionally, I have seen the Yala monsoon starts in May and gets worse to August, would the first two weeks in May be too late to travel and enjoy the SW? Lookingfor some sun too!

"Trapped on a Freezing Rooftop at an Airbnb—Host Abandoned Us, Airbnb Refuses Compensation",0,1i1mub2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i1mub2/trapped_on_a_freezing_rooftop_at_an_airbnbhost/,9,1736906488.0,"On New Year’s Eve, my family and I rented a townhouse through Airbnb in London. At midnight, we stepped onto the rooftop to watch fireworks using a mechanized skylight that malfunctioned and locked behind us, trapping us outside in freezing temperatures. We were barefoot, in light clothing, and had no phones, credit cards, or alternatives, as we only planned to be out there for a few minutes.

After being stranded for nearly 30 minutes, we were rescued by a neighbor staying in the same building, who contacted the host on our behalf. The host promised to send someone with a key but never showed up. At 2 AM, they admitted they couldn’t find the key and then stopped responding entirely.

Desperate and with no other options, I had to call an emergency locksmith to drill and replace the lock at a cost of $987.50. Airbnb initially offered $1,500 in compensation but later reduced their offer and ultimately refused to cover the locksmith fee, citing their AirCover policy and filing this under “broken or missing amenities.” I then asked for escalation with the same result.

I believe this incident demonstrates serious negligence by the host, who failed to provide a safe and accessible stay. It also highlights a flaw in Airbnb’s policy when guests are forced to bear the costs of emergencies caused by the host’s failures.

Should I pursue a chargeback or escalate further? Has anyone else had similar experiences? Any advice is appreciated.",,,

Seeing as how we're going more into an off season, we would be thrilled to go to more popular cities if they aren't nearly as packed. We have a hotel booked for the first couple of nights in Lefkada, near Frini. I do have concerns about available ferries to get to Lefkada from whichever airport we arrive at.

I enjoy planning trips, but I do feel a bit apprehensive about transportation and picking places that may be too far away and cuts time out of our days.

American guy here wanting to secure documents for getting a Korean F4 visa, but currently unsure if I'm eligible. 

My grandmother, as far as I know, is still a Korean citizen since she isn't an American citizen and only has her green card and resident alien status, despite living here in the US for probably over 50 years now, only having gone back to visit Korea a few times since then. My mother was born here and raised here in America and has never been to Korea. I am the same way. 

I was reading and some of the stuff I read said that my mother might have had citizenship transfer over when she was born that might have never gotten officially renounced or something?

I was born in '06 (18), my mother was born in '87 (38), and my grandmother is in her late 60s to early 70s so she would have been born around '55-'60 or so.

Irrelevant background info:
I really value my Korean heritage a bunch having grown up real close with my grandmother and have spent a long time since I was a child learning Korean on-and-off. I know I'm going to travel there someday in the next 5 or 10 years and may even go to live there eventually. I hope to enroll in some actual classes sometime in the next few years because self-study is just not my thing. To most people I don't look Korean at all and I know I'm gonna be treated just the same as any Yank, but this is more just about trying to scrape some benefits from the visa if I'm able.",,,

Hi,

2 years ago i visited the Maldives and one of the things i loved the most is the lack of crowd.

During the dining time obvisouly the restaurant was full but other than that you could spend your time on the beach with just 1-2 people around you and even the common places like the snorkeling area had like 5-10 people at most.

So i'm looking to see if there are any resorts that you can recommend and reachable from Europe.

I don't have prefered time so it could be any season.

The budget is up to 2000 euro/person (flight + accomodation).

I cannot name any other similat destination, that is why i am writing this post to get new ideas.

It is important it does not have to be an island but a place where the accomodationt are either small villas or bungalows and not a huge hotel with hundreds of people.

Maybe someone has some good recommandation.

I can understand this as these are small, boutique hotels, but I do want to cover my bases. 

I have not purchased travel insurance before but was researching travel insurance that offers ""Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR)"" inclusions. These policies cost slightly more (it would be $350-$550) to insure the non-refundable portions of our trip ($7500). And, if we were not able to go and were to cancel we would be reimbursed 75% of the expense.

I am wondering if anyone has had experience with these kinds of policies before and what the general thought about them is. ",,,

Guardian Angel Abroad? ,8,1i0mlb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0mlb9/guardian_angel_abroad/,6,1736797307.0,"Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I saw a similar story on this sub that reminded me of this experience and I wanted to share. 

Back in 2015, my best friend and I were studying abroad in London. We are from the states. for our spring break, we traveled to four different cities: Venice, Rome, Amsterdam and Berlin. I was the planner of the group with a pretty good sense of direction, so I did the majority of the research. Back in 2015, there was no free international data like there is now, the only other option was to get a SIM card. We both had opted not to, as a lot of people did, and for the most part it wasn’t a problem. You simply look up directions when you have WiFi, read maps and travel like the good old days. 

Anyway, on our fourth and final city we traveled to Berlin. We got in a little late, not terribly late but I want to say around 9 pm. Couldn’t tell you what airport because it’s been too long. We were supposed to take the Bahn to our hostel, which we had previously mapped out. However, when we finished getting through customs and got outside, the last train had apparently left for the night. Already being outside the airport, we no longer had internet access. We began asking people if they spoke English, getting more frantic as most people either A. Did not or B. We’re also lost. It seemed like a lot of people were not aware of the train stopping (which made us feel better). Finally we found our savior, a German man who had recently returned home and was quite familiar with the area. From what I remember, he was tall, husky and had a beard. He had an almost cherubic face despite being probably in his late 30s.

He told us what bus to get on and what stop to get off, he was also taking that bus but for a different stop. We thanked him, got on the bus and adapted to our new route. Unfortunately, as all the stops were German names and our 20 year old (exhausted from traveling) selves got off at the wrong stop. It’s hard to say exactly because of it being a foreign country… but the stop we got off seemed very sketchy. No people around and places looking a bit run down. We quickly realized our mistake and began frantically trying to decipher the German bus map to get back on the bus and get to the correct stop. Just our luck, that particular bus was on its last run and now we were really freaking out. 

As we’re looking for a route to walk or a midnight bus, we hear someone yelling. We turn around and lo and behold, our German friend is running to us down the street. “You got off the wrong stop!!” He yells, as my friend and I look at each other in disbelief. He catches up to us, out of breath, and says we got off the wrong stop and he noticed and immediately got off at the next stop and ran back to help us. However, he knows the way and it’s not a far walk from where we are now. Now I know what you’re thinking, two young, beautiful girls in a foreign city at night with a man who seems way too helpful to get us to a hostel? No way! But… I listened to my gut, and my gut said this guy was safe. 

He walked us to the hostel, and gave a bit of a “German scolding” like I used to get to from my first gen German grandma. He got us to the hostel after about a 10/15 min walk and we thanked him profusely and even offered him money even though at the time all I had was 50€ for the rest of the trip. He refused our money, wished us a good visit and was on his way. 

For a few days I was a bit worried he’d show up at the hostel but we never saw him again. I am to this day, almost a decade later, convinced he was either a guardian angel, or was directly
instructed by a higher being to help us. ",,,
What's reasonable compensation to demand for a broken business class seat?,0,1i193uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i193uw/whats_reasonable_compensation_to_demand_for_a/,19,1736869984.0,"I recently flew Manchester (UK) to Delhi (India) overnight with a stopover in Abu Dhabi with Etihad in business class.

I've requested compensation noting specifically that I'm not a frequent traveller and points ant really mean anything to me.

7 weeks later and 3 chasers they have offered me 10K points or a 100 USD voucher on my next flight. Besides the fact the both are pretty much useless to me, I don't think this is a fair offer.

A similar flight - in the next 3 months e.g. Mis currently priced at £99 in economy vs £685 in business class - I think this should be the benchmark of compensation. £586. They have refused to budge.

What d you think is fair and any suggestions on how I can take this forward?

My favorite travel story - I fell in love with a dog in Tbilisi,270,1hzs1ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hzs1ra/my_favorite_travel_story_i_fell_in_love_with_a/,20,1736703524.0,"Someone once asked me what was the most romantic, poignant, heartbreaking thing that happened in all my travels.  I told them the truth – once upon a time, I fell in love with a dog in Tbilisi. I was sitting on a bench, and she walked up to me, large and shaggy, looking a bit like an Airedale terrier mix with the sweetest eyes. I had no food on me, and she didn't seem to be looking for food.  She sat on the ground and leaned her entire body weight against my leg as if we were old friends.  She followed me around all day, nuzzling my hands every chance she got, begging for cuddles, wagging her tail against the back of my knees. She even followed me inside the restaurant and laid down under the table. I tried to apologize to the owner, but he waved me off, “Don’t worry, friend!”  It seemed like he knew this dog. I shared my lunch with her and later my dinner and left her sleeping on the doorstep of my hotel in the late evening. I woke up in the morning and there she was, staring at me with the sweetest eyes from the hotel stoop.

I had no idea what to do. I was supposed to leave for my next destination that afternoon. Do I cancel my trip? Do I take her to the vet and arrange for a way to take her home, to the U.S.? I can't just abandon this dog, who clearly loves me, on the street, can I? We were walking to breakfast, me and the dog, while I was mulling over my thoughts. An old Georgian woman sitting on a bench greeted me and the dog warmly, ""Oh, I see you met our Ella! You are her tourist of the day, huh?"" I asked her what she meant, and she laughed, ""She knows who is a tourist and who is local! She knows tourists are nice and will feed her all day! She always finds a tourist for a day! She is a smart girl!"" The dog wagged her tail excitedly.

 I am not going to lie; I was a bit heartbroken. I was taken for a ride, I made an unwilling sugar daddy, I was duped. I fed Ella her breakfast and lunch and left for the Georgian mountains that day. She watched me go with loving eyes, never breaking character to the end. As my car pulled off, I saw her head back toward the restaurant where we had lunch. The owner put out a fresh water dish for her.

I often think of Tbilisi and Ella. The memory of that entire city is permeated with her musky smell, the feel of her wet nose, the look of her loving eyes. I wonder if she would have had a happier life if I took her home - locked her up in a condo all day, gave her a rushed walk every morning and night, took her to the vet... Or is she happier living in her city where everyone knows her, the locals adore her, the tourists feed her, and she spends her days showing new arrivals her beautiful city and making them fall in love with her and Tbilisi?   I know the truth in my heart and as I travel through life, the discovery of every new city and meeting every homeless dog flood my mind with bittersweet memories of what was not meant to be.",,,
11 Days in New Zealand for Two | North & South Island Itinerary,1,1i0sgsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0sgsl/11_days_in_new_zealand_for_two_north_south_island/,0,1736812307.0,"Dates: Dec 24, 2024 – Jan 3, 2025

**DAY 1:** Auckland  
**Stayed:** President Hotel  
*Tip*: Ask for a top-floor room. Lower floors feel like a completely different (and not great) hotel. 😅  
**Recommendations:**

* Auckland Art Gallery. A great museum to start your trip.
* The Occidental. A cozy pub for drinks and food.

**DAY 2:** Waitomo Glowworm Caves & Rotorua  
**Stayed:** Ambassador Thermal Motel – Nothing fancy, just a regular motel.  
**Recommendations:**

* Waitomo Glowworm Caves. **A must-visit!** The glowworms are magical.
* Polynesian Spa in Rotorua. Don't forget to remove your silver jewelry! Mine turned completely dark.
* Number 8 Wire restaurant.

**DAY 3:** Hobbiton™ Movie Set Tour  
If you love ""The Lord of the Rings,"" this is a dream come true. Another **must-visit!**  
Back to Auckland. Stayed again at the President Hotel.

**DAY 4:** Flight to Queenstown (South Island)  
**Stayed:** Airbnb in Jack's Point  
The landscape is completely different from the North Island. Honestly, I liked the South Island more, but places like the Glowworm Caves and Hobbiton are unmissable.

**DAYS 5 – 7:** Exploring the South Island  
We drove around as much as possible to soak in the beauty of this magical place.  
**Recommendations:**

* Wanaka Lavender Farm
* Hooker Valley Track (hike).
* Routeburn Nature Walk (hike).

**DAY 8:** Milford Sound Boat Trip  
The 2.5-hour trip is unforgettable. Book the earliest slot possible – parking is a nightmare.  
Moved to Wanaka: stayed overnight.

**DAY 9:** Wanaka  
**Stayed:** Airbnb in Wanaka. So far my favorite city in New Zealand  
**Recommendations:**

* Untouched World Wanaka. A great store with handmade wool clothing.
* \#ThatWanakaTree. A spot for a photo.
* Kai Pai Bakery. I love their pies.

**DAY 10:** Oamaru & Alexandra  
**Stayed:**Airbnb in Alexandra  
Tried to see blue penguins in Oamaru but learned they only appear at sunset. Missed them, but we visited Steampunk HQ Museum – Not a fan of steampunk, but it was still super cool and worth the drive.

**DAY 11:** Back to Queenstown & Auckland  
**Stayed:** BK's Pioneer Motel in Auckland.  Decent option with a free airport shuttle.  
Drove to Queenstown and flew back to Auckland. Flew back to LA the next day.

New Zealand is breathtaking. The North Island has unique gems like the Glowworm Caves and Hobbiton, while the South Island looks straight out of a postcard with its blue lakes and mountains. Highly recommend exploring both!

"Trip to Boston, MA in late February?",4,1i0hhze,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0hhze/trip_to_boston_ma_in_late_february/,7,1736784815.0,"Hi, my girlfriend and I are trying to take 3-4 day trip around the 20th. We're young (I'm 20, shes 21), so our main goal is not spending a ton of money. For context, we live in mid-Michigan, so we aren't afraid of cold weather and snow, however we still want to enjoy our time and be able to walk as much as possible. 

We picked Boston because honestly, it's fairly cheap right now. Flights and hotel would add up to about $500 for both of us. But also, we have never been to the New England area. We love history, museums, all that stuff. We aren't crazy into the colonial era but will enjoy the history regardless. I've been to D.C. twice, and as much as I'd love to take her, I'm not quite feeling like going again. Oh, we also love paranormal/witch stuff, so we will be visiting Salem even if it's a tourist trap. 

Here's my concerns about going to Boston:

1. Weather

It's February. It will be cold and snowy, and we can handle that to an extent. I'm just worried it will be so wintery that we won't want to leave the hotel. Again, we're from Michigan, and today it's 27° with two inches of snow, so we aren't wimps in cold weather. But I don't have to go walking around in this weather. 

Also, the likelihood of hitting a snowstorm and having our flights cancelled. She's currently in a school that only allows 3 absences in a month and we are already taking 2.5 for the trip. 

2. Transportation

As far as I can tell, it's very difficult/expensive to rent a car under 25 yo. Is there enough RELIABLE public transportation for us to travel around? We're ok with Lyft/Uber occasionally, but we don't want to have to spend that every time we go somewhere. 

3. Things to do

Once again, it's February. We're we live, February is a total ghost town besides one small chili cook-off. However, Boston has 6x the population of our hometown. Are there enough events and things to visit in order to fill out a 4 day stay? 
Another factor, I'm not 21 yet. Going out for drinks isnt an option. 

I've check the r/Boston subreddit and they have a travel guide, I'm just worried about the time of year affecting what we can do.

Anyway, I would appreciate any advice, Boston related or not. Maybe there's somewhere we have overlooked that would be a better trip for us. 


EDIT: One other question I forgot to add. 
We're trying to fly with just personal bags, no carry-ons/checked. If we can it's saves over $100. I have a backpack that doesn't quite fit within the size limits, however it can squish down even with it fully packed. Will this be ok for the flight, or should I look into another bag?",,,

We’re currently visiting Austria, and absolutely loving it here. 

We’re a very respectful, polite, and cheerful couple. Between us, we speak a very little German, as well as pretty good English, French, Spanish, Russian and even Japanese!

Austria as a whole (1 month in now, and especially Vienna) is simply stunning, with incredible infrastructure and such a rich culture. We’ve been comparing it to Paris in terms of beauty, but it’s so much cleaner and, honestly, more pleasant to navigate—so that’s a big plus for us, haha.

However, we’ve noticed one small thing that’s been slightly less positive so far: the friendliness and helpfulness of the locals. Without meaning any disrespect, we were wondering if this is just our experience or if there’s a cultural tendency in German-speaking regions to be a bit more reserved or distant?

Of course, I’m not saying people in France are particularly friendlier (especially in Paris!), but in most of our travels (like Italy, Spain, or even Berlin!), we’ve experienced more smiles and offers of help when needed (whenever I try here even with a not so good German speaking ability, I usually get a stare and closed non smiling face)..

Is this just how things are here, or have we simply been unlucky so far, or misbehaving without knowing? 

We’d love to hear your thoughts!

I would love any advice/tips you all may have about where to stay, things to do, areas around Arenal or other cool places I may not have considered. 

A few things:

\- price doesn't matter as much. I am not looking to save as much money as possible and would prefer nicer/pricier places to stay (we are all in our late 30s with established careers, we have done the penny-pinching travel experiences so looking towards nicer places this time around)

\- Looking for places on or very near the beach (walking distance) and near areas to get food easily (air bnb, hotels, etc)

\- Hikes through jungles/rainforests (light to moderate hikes; we are all fit and enjoy outdoors but aren't looking to backpack 27 miles through the jungle; guided tours are cool too) or other fun experiences 

\- Any other resorts that you would recommend?

\- I'm not huge on nightlife but if there are any cool spots to check out, I'd love to hear about them!

Prescription label for medicine when flying internationally (non-USA to USA),2,1i0k3zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0k3zt/prescription_label_for_medicine_when_flying/,4,1736791272.0,"Hi! I'll be flying internationally for the first time in a few months and I need your help. I have almost no experience when it comes to flying, so maybe these questions may seem dumb to you, but I need to ask them. :) I'll be flying from Frankfurt (I'm from Europe) to Hawaii with layovers in San Francisco and Vancouver (on my way back).

I have asthma and I'll be flying with inhalers. On the CBP site (https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) it says: ""In general, you should have with you a valid prescription or doctor’s note—written in English—to bring medication to the U.S.""

Also, I've read somewhere that the medicine needs to be labeled.

What is your experience when flying to USA with inhalers? Are TSA and CBP strict? What happens if I don't have my medicine labeled or a doctor's note? I'm kind of confused because I already asked my asthma doctor if that note is necessary and if she could write it - she said that it's not necessary and that people fly with inhalers without a problem, that no one takes them away. So that's why I had to ask you. I have no problem asking her again, of course.

Also, if I understand correctly, I have to declare my inhalers, is that correct? Maybe I didn't understand that right because it seems weird to me.

But now I'm wondering whether a backpack would be a good idea for convenience or if it's even that important..? We'll be travelling for 5 days in Rome first, 3 weeks in the Phuket/Krabi area in Thailand, 1 week in Hanoi, 2 weeks in Japan, 3 weeks in the Philippines and then 1 week in Bali. From what I've read it seems to be okay in every country besides the Philippines to travel with a suitcase or am I wrong?

We're not going to be die-hard backpackers, as we're staying in hotels the whole way, besides in the Philippines, and neither are we going hiking or such.. so what are your suggestions as to which I should pick?

I had been seriously looking at the Osprey Farpoint Trek 75 or 55 litre backpack (I need a backpack with clamshell opening), and I've been leaning more towards the 75 litre because of Rome where we need a bit warmer clothing and as I want to buy some stuff in Asia and bring home.

I will be flying into Bengaluru, staying there for a day and a half, then taking a 6 hour bus ride to Hampi where I will stay for four days before returning to Bengaluru for one more day and leaving. 

I imagine I will have wifi in all the places that matter, therefore I feel like I can just turn off cellular data and use WhatsApp for the duration of my trip.

My boyfriend and I (early 20s) are planning a trip to Ecuador for March and need travel advice. We are adventurous and outdoorsy but not into very dangerous extreme sports. We love hiking, cultural experiences, yoga, animal sightings, etc. and need more ideas of things to do at the locations we’ve picked out. We’d generally prefer to do things outside of pre-planned, paid tours, but of course sometimes it’s worth it! So if you have any tour recommendations, please let me know. 

1. We are planning to fly into Quito and go straight to a yoga cabin in the Mindo cloud forest, then do the 3 waterfall sanctuary hike the next day. We’d also like to walk around Mindo a bit and potentially do a coffee/chocolate tasting. 

2. We’d then head to Cotopaxi. We found a hostel that does airport retrievals, and we were curious if it would be a good idea to go back to the airport after Mindo as I know there are no buses that go straight into Cotopaxi. If you have any other ideas for this let me know. We’re also struggling finding things to do in Cotopaxi, such as a good hike that is not actually summiting Cotopaxi. We don’t need to spend too much time there but would like to get a good hike in, and if there are other cool cultural experiences to do during the day or night, please let me know. 

3. After that we’d like to head to Baños. Here is where we hit a wall- we need some solid recommendations for Baños. I’ve also been reading that it’s imperative to visit Puyo if you’re going to Baños, which we can allot for time wise, but I cannot pinpoint anything to actually do there other that pre-planned jungle tours. Is that it? If so, can someone recommend me one that is worth the money? 

Thanks so much. We originally planned to stay in Ayampe/Montanita as well as the rainforest, as we both surf and love the bohemian vibe, however deemed it was maybe too much to do in one trip and didn’t want to spend the whole time traveling. If you think we should reconsider, let me know, but since cutting it out we are low on the activities list. 

Also, I’m prone to migraines and altitude sickness, and with all of the altitude change within this trip I was wondering if anyone had any tips to alleviate or prevent it. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. 

Furthermore, we’re aware of the political climate we’re going into, and if you have any safety tips or precautions to be aware of, please let me know. Anything helps.

I asked if I would get my money back, and they replied: ""Hello (name), after you cancel your reservation we will forward it to our financial team to proceed with the refund process""

I was suspicious, but I canceled anyway. After that, they no longer replied to my messages. The next thing for me was to write a message to the Booking team to see if they could do something about this.

I'm sending a screenshot of the message they sent me:

I'm kind of tired of using Booking at this point, they are pretty much useless and you pay more than you would if you just directly message the property, but I at least thought I would be safe from this kind of BS. Last year an apartment account sent me a phishing link, it was obvious, so I didn't type my credit card details. Not getting scammed on Booking is a coin flip at this point.

Google flights is pretty much giving me two options only, with a single stop option, them being:

British Airways/American with a stop in London (LHR)
Or Lufthansa/United with a stop in Munich (MUC)

BA seems the cheaper option and also has a much shorter layover. However, since they are paired up with American, i'm hesitant. I've heard that they have a pretty bad reputation. And as for the layover in London Heathrow, i've never had one there so idk if it's hectic there or, well or badly  organized. And i think even for the transit the new ETA applies? I guess?

Lufthansa is much more expensive and the layover for all the flights i've checked (and i checked probably all possible options) is 6 hours minimum. BA in comparison is about 2hrs which is very reasonable. I've flown with Lufthansa before and even though i don't think they are outstanding, i feel like i'd feel safer with them. Same goes for the layover in Munich. Lufthansa has frequent strikes though so i hope that won't be an issue.

So from people's experiences, should i go for the, probably safer option?, Lufthansa, and pay more? Or is British Airways and American actually decent and i could/should use them and save some money and on unnecessary layover time?

Edit: I checked transit times for a better comparison. 
BA/AA: LUX to LHR layover of 2h45m. CLT to LHR layover of 1h (only 💀).
LH/U: LUX to MUC layover of 2h15m. CLT to MUC layover of 5h50.",,,

Head down to the Sinbad Beach Club (13JOD pp)  
via free shuttle service (inc in the price of beach club pass)  
Boat trip (23JOD pp) and SCUBA diving (50JOD pp)

Day 5:   
Taxi out to Wadi Rum (20/25JOD)  
Can't remember the name of the camp but it is 25 JOD/night  
Sunset camel ride (15 JOD pp)

Day 6 (Optional day):  
Private 6 hour Jeep tour of Wadi Rum sights (80JOD)

Day 7:   
Early morning taxi up to Petra (40 JOD)  
Enter Petra that day and hike up to the Monastery  
La Maison Hotel (30JOD)

Day 8:   
Private taxi from Petra to Amman Airport (70JOD)  
Catch flight home 

Notes:   
I appreciate that most would want to spend more time in Petra to see more but the Monastery roundtrip walk will take 2.5-3 hours alone and we'd be pretty tired especially as it is at the end of our trip.   
We would rather get to spend our time taking in the Treasury and Monastery then running around trying to see it all.   
You could in theory skip the extra day in Aqaba for an extra day at Petra but we want the time in Aqaba. 

We have planned this to be a seamless ampersand shape of the country, connecting each part to allow for transport links.   
  
We have been contacting drivers for months haggling for the best price. (Some of the prices for cars we have seen online are crazy)  
Also, if we meet any solo travellers we will offer to share our ride with them for a contributary fee. 

Anyone else taking advantage of the cheap Ryanair flights to Jordan?

I'm visiting Iguazu falls soon, really looking forward to it. I am flying into IGR airport on the Argentina side, looking to go straight to the Brazilian side of the falls then back to Puerto Iguazu for the night before spending the next day on the Argentina side.

The first day to me seems like it might be a bit stressful with a lot of buses back and forth. From what I have read on here and elsewhere, I need to go to Puerto Iguazu centre, get a bus to Foz, then to the falls. Then doing the same in reverse in the afternoon. Given I land at 0945 (assuming my flight is on time) I feel like a transfer might possibly be worthwhile. 

I've found a quote for just under $110 for a private transfer covering there and back. What I was wondering was whether people had any recommendations for other providers that might be lower, maybe even a shared transfer, or whether anyone has recent experience of the buses and might be able to give a better idea for costs and timings via that option.

I saw that they standardized carry on sizes, so I was going to get a new suitcase since I can't find my old one. I was looking at  one on Amazon, which is 21.5 x 9.5 x 14.5 inches, which is a half inch bigger than the spec from a youtube video that listed the size as 22 x 14 x 9 inches, but that should be fine? I haven't flown in years, so I don't know how strict they are about it these days. Or maybe a different one would be better? It's dimensions are listed as 13.4 x 8.6 x 20 inches would be better?

This May, we are fortunate to spend a month traveling through French Polynesia. In 2022, we had the chance to explore this beautiful destination, visiting Moorea, Bora Bora, Huahine, and Papeete. This time, we’re planning to discover new islands and have drafted an itinerary that includes Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa, Maupiti, Bora Bora, and Papeete.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially regarding:

* **Time allocation for Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa:** Do we have enough days planned to fully experience these islands?
* **Raiatea:** We’re debating whether to include Raiatea in our itinerary, as it’s the only Society Island we haven’t visited yet. What do you think?

Here’s our draft itinerary:

Nuku Hiva: 6 nights

Hiva Oa: 5 nights

Maupiti: 4 nights

Bora Bora: 5 nights

Papeete: 3 nights

What are your thoughts on this itinerary? Are there any must-see places or activities on the islands we’ve included? And is it worth adding Raiatea to the trip, even with an already packed schedule?

1. Cappadocia - Izmir - Chios: Seems like the most straightforward way as we can get on a flight from Kayseri to Izmir, then a ferry to Chios. But there doesn't seem to be any ferry out from there.
2. Cappadocia - Kusadasi - Samos: Will have to bum it out in an overnight bus to Kusadasi, then take a ferry to Samos. Again, not sure how to get to Crete or Santorini from Samos.
3. Cappadocia - Istanbul - Crete / Santorini: Fairly straightforward, but will probably involve a flight from Istanbul to Athens then to the Greek islands.

If I get a quote for single trip, it asks for a destination and the cost of the trip, which makes the insurance go up to $163 for this single trip.

Why in the world would getting the annual plan, which has the exact same coverage per trip taken (no matter how many), and covers any and all trips within the year, including the Japan one I just did a single-trip quote for, cost so much less? Why do they not care with the annual plan how much you're planning to spend, etc, which is what makes the single trip insurance cost more?

I think this has come up before, but it's been a while and I didn't see any good explanations -- just makes me feel like I'm missing something somewhere.

We have been looking at some river cruises in Iquitos and have narrowed it down to the the Aqua Nera, Aria Amazon and Zafiro. As Aqua and Aria are the same operator, we are leaning towards Aria due to price as the experience would be the same in terms of activities etc. Zafiro is cheaper than the others but im not sure about the experience as it takes a different route. Has anyone had experience on any of these and can provide feedback? 

For MP we would stay is Cucso for a day or two to acclimatise before heading out. I have heard that there are two types of trails and options for trains that lead up to the site.

Thoughts on our India 16 day itinerary?,1,1i0crqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0crqu/thoughts_on_our_india_16_day_itinerary/,31,1736771054.0,"Looking for some feedback on our very ambitious India itinerary. We are mum (49) and daughter (21), first time to India, have done a fair bit of travel in South East Asia and Nepal. So we have a bit of an idea about humidity, chaos, etc but understand it will be on another level in India.

Our booked dates are 17 July to 03 Aug, we know monsoon is not a fantastic time to be in some of the places mentioned, we only have the opportunity to travel between these dates though.

We have done lots of trips where we have stayed just a day in multiple places and prefer to see a bit more of a country this way than spending all our time getting to know 1 or 2 places. We enjoy packing loads into each day with early starts and late finishes and not much sleep between. So we know this looks like  we are trying to pack too many cities into a short trip but keep in mind that we don’t mind travelling this way.

We are aware train delays are common and are prepared to have to drop things if this happens.

We love trains.

We love food, cafes, street food, food markets.

We work in social justice, equity, human rights fields so places working towards these goals are of interest to us.

We are interested in history, art and architecture but don’t want to spend the majority of our time in forts and temples.

We love hiking, nature and wildlife, prefer mountains, desert, or forest but not coastal or beaches.

If we were going to ditch anything it would be Udaipur and Jaipur. We know we should only do Leh or Kochi but we have decided we definitely want to do both – hopefully there will be an opportunity to do more of Kerala in a future trip when weather is better. We are open to suggestions, changing other things around and have been considering Lucknow instead of Jaipur and Udaipur.",,,
Overwhelmed trying to find the perfect all inclusive in Mexico for our next retreat! HELP!,0,1i0q0ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0q0ah/overwhelmed_trying_to_find_the_perfect_all/,9,1736805821.0,"My partner and I (29 and 30) are planning on taking a vacation to Mexico May 2025 and are currently on the hunt for an all inclusive resort that meet our budget, aesthetic and amenity needs and boy are we overwhelmed by the options and reviews that are available. We would love to get more insight from those with experience so we can narrow down our options and find a place that suits the type of vacation we are looking to experience.

Price: We would like keep price under $3000 per person for a week stay. We may be able to stretch a bit but its just not ideal for such a short period of time for us.

Aesthetic: Lush and tropical, modernized in the sense that its not outdated or worn, but not too modern that it looks sterile and bare. We love modern/contemporary as much as traditional and tropical - it just needs to be warm, inviting, and quality. We also love a natural landscape and do not mind nature and forest heavy spaces, but direct beach access is a must as we are ocean people and will probably not spend a lot of time at the pool.

Amenities: Quality food and drinks, a clean and comfortable room, and great service are the next things we value the most. We like quality a la cartes as well as buffet style and would prefer to have some variety rather than being limited to 1 or 2 places.

Our key non-negotiable items are beach, food, service, and lush tropical surroundings!

On that note, our avoidables: no beach access, over budget, party heavy atmosphere

Advice around travel timing - Peru & Colombia,1,1i0azz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0azz3/advice_around_travel_timing_peru_colombia/,4,1736763705.0,"I am planning a 5 week trip to Peru and Colombia around April/May. I am hoping to get some advice on the following questions if anyone has some experience.

1. I want to do 3 weeks in Peru and 2 weeks in Colombia. Is that a good split of time? Enough to do most of the important stuff in Peru with some time to do a decent amount of stuff in Colombia. 

2. Would anyone recommend just doing 5 weeks in Peru? Seems like 3 weeks is good enough to do most of the greatest hits? Any other recommendations, 4 weeks Peru and 1 week Bolivia?

3. Looking at the weather in each country, it seems Peru is best starting in May and Colombia is best ending in March. With that in mind is it a good idea to do something like Mid April Colombia and start of May Peru? My Peru leg of the trip is much more important to me, I don’t want rain for the whole of the Colombia trip but as long as it’s decent and the Peru part is great (if that makes sense).

Dates at this stage are 100% flexible I just want to make sure I get the ideal timing.

I’m planning a trip from February 1st to 14th, covering Istanbul, Cappadocia, Antalya, Fethiye, Rhodes, and Pamukkale.

I intend to take the ferry from Fethiye to Rhodes on February 8th at 08:25, spend a night in Rhodes, and return on February 9th at 15:00.

However, I’m concerned about the reliability of these ferry services during the off-season.

Specifically:
	
1.	Do these ferries operate as scheduled in early February, or are cancellations and schedule changes common?
	
2.	If the February 9th 15:00 ferry from Rhodes to Fethiye is canceled, are there alternative ways to return to Turkey?
	
3.	Given the potential risks of schedule changes in winter, would it be advisable to skip Rhodes and focus solely on traveling within Turkey?

It’s not possible to visit the south on your own. We booked this trip through an agency in Algiers. The visa process in Algeria is difficult but if a large chunck of your visit is in the South you can get a visa on arrival, which we did.

It was an amazing experience. Our guides were fun, warm and welcoming. We got a nice glimpse of Tuareg life. And the views and nature were out of this world.",,,

I've mostly finalized my itinerary but still fine tuning a few things and thought i'd ask for some feedback here.  Here is the rough itinerary.

Flying into Bucharest and then immediately flying to Timisoara to start my travels there.  Since i'm starting mid July the plan is to start in the north where it's cooler and then end up back in Bucharest when it has cooled down in the Fall.

July 15 - Aug 13 : 4 nights in Timisoara, 3 nights in Oradea, 1 week in Cluj, 3 nights in Sighisoara, 2 weeks in Sibiu  
Aug 14 - Sep 10 : 1 month in Brasov  
Sep 11 - Oct 9 : 1 month in Bucharest

The 1 month in Bucharest may be a bit odd but it is a personal choice.  Also the 1 month in Brasov is fixed in my plans.

I am mostly looking for great hiking opportunities since I am an outdoor enthusiast, however the issue is I don't have a car and unfortunately I don't have my IDP at the moment and it looks like that is necessary to rent a car in Romania and getting one via the AAA shipped international is a pretty convoluted process and the other options are not only shady but ridiculously expensive ($150+) so the gist of it is that I will be relying on public transport.

Given this info, am I making the right decision to spend 2 weeks in Sibiu or should I spend more time in Cluj or other areas?  The reason I am on the fence here is that I have heard public transport into the Fagaras mountains is hit or miss but I also hear that there are options to hike in the Cindrel mountains that are well connected.  Also perhaps better hiking near Sibiu itself?

Cluj has the Apuseni mountains but not sure if the hiking opportunities are as impressive as Sibiu.  Thoughts?

So we are early 50s. Somewhat basing it off a trip friends did a couple years ago, where they stayed at a more adventurous place for. a few days, and then went to an all inclusive beach resort in Guanacaste. I just booked the 'adventurous' place, Hotel Hacienda Guachipelin. Trying to see some waterfalls or do ziplines, nature stuff, etc.

Their Guanacaste resort was Dreams Las Mareas. We actually had this kinda planned by a travel agent back in October, but then got distracted and didn't book it, so now I'm doing it myself. This Dreams place on [hotels.com](http://hotels.com) is like $1500/ night, which is well beyond our budget. Our budget might be more like $500/night. For 4 nights.  Is this even reasonable to get a decent place at that rate?

We're not drinkers. My wife not at all, and I just occasionally try new drinks, so the alcohol is not the main draw of the all-inclusive. Mainly just convenience. I would also like actual restaurants and not just a buffett. Definitely doesn't have to be luxurious, just nice.

We are trying to do this week of Feb 8-15. Yes, totally dropped the ball. Tried to plan it back in the fall and then just got busy, then holidays, now here we are. So yea, kinda stressing out. I've also looked into flights into LIB, they actually surprisingly seem decent ($500-ish).

I also use a tutor on Italki for extra practice, and she is from Mexico City), I also have Chilean friends and the basics of the Spanish aren’t drastically different to me. However, I have also been getting used to the chilenismos for a little while now!

Itinerary check for Northern Italy ,1,1i0365n,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i0365n/itinerary_check_for_northern_italy/,12,1736733306.0,"Just booked plane tickets. Myself, wife and 2 kids Flying into Venice on June 27 and out of Milan July 14th. 

My thoughts are as follows:
Venice: 
Arrive June 27th (easy day)
28th & 29th explore Venice 
30th explore nearby islands 
31st & 1st explore Venice more - maybe a day trip but not sure where? Considering removing a day from Venice because typing this it feels like a lot of time. 

Check out July 2 train to Verona or somewhere else? Thoughts?

Verona?:
July 2 arrive and spend July 2-4 exploring ( i know- short stop here, but didn't want to take away from the next stops)

July 4 - 8 Dolemites 
July 8 - 13 Lake Garda 
July 13 relocate to Milan near airport- fly home 14th. 

Should I switch when I visit Dolemites and Lake Garda? Logistically it looks like doing Dolemites 1st makes sense but maybe Lake Garda then Dolemites is better. Can I rent a vehicle in Verona when I'm leaving? I'm assuming yes because I think ill need one for Dolemites and the Lake. 

Should I skip Verona? I feel more interested in Parma or Bologna but Verona seems on the way. 

Lastly, should I take a day or 2 from Venice, Lake Garda or Dolemites to make the Verona stop longer to allow a day trip?

Appreciate any input. Thanks!",,,

2 Weeks in Portugal,1,1i02sk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i02sk5/2_weeks_in_portugal/,1,1736732144.0,"Hi!  I am traveling to Portugal in May 2025 for a wedding with my fiance, my parents, and my sister.  I am flying into Porto on Thursday May 15th at 9am local time and will spend two nights in Porto.  I wanted to spend a day or two in Duoro Valley & would be looking for recs: either taking 2 day-trips to the DV and wine tasting, or is it worth it to spend 2 nights out there?  I was planning on taking the train but could rent a car if necessary

I am then traveling from DV/Porto by train down to Lagos.  A friend is staying at Casa Mae, but I am looking for more budget friendly options in that area, and also would be open to a house with my parents & sister (3 bedrooms & 2-3 bathrooms).  

SO MY QUESTIONS ULTIMATELY:

1. Duoro Valley - worth it for 2 seperate day-trips and stay based in Porto?  Or worth it to spend 2 nights in DV, and if so, what would you recommend (<$400/night) & ideally looking to stay at a vineyard or B&B, but also want to be close to any other action in the area-- unsure WHERE to actually stay in DV.  
2. Porto - we are still doing 2 nights here - any hotel recs under $250 near city center?  Or should I up my budget / expectations?
3. Lagos - hotels/guest houses (3 bedroom) near ""city center"" Lagos for 3 nights.  

  
We are then traveling to Caiscais for the wedding & staying at Hotel Albatroz.

  
Thank you for your recs!",,,

Total Expenses from 28 days in South America (2 ppl in 30's),82,1hz91g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hz91g7/total_expenses_from_28_days_in_south_america_2/,4,1736638214.0,"Hopefully this will be helpful to some of you that want to know how much traveling really costs! I just got back from nearly a month in S.A. with my girlfriend and we had a fantastic time. We went to Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, we barely speak Spanish, we felt safe the whole time (were reasonably careful though) and I wouldn't say we balled out on expenses, but we also didn't do everything as cheaply as possible nor shy away from doing whatever we wanted. 9 airplanes and various trains, boats, ferries, buses, and taxis later, I'm finally home.

  
Total cost of flights from Denver to Lima to Cusco to La Paz to Bogota to Medellin to Denver: $3,260 (USD).

Traveling in December and around the holidays made the flights a bit more expensive and we also checked both our bags every time, so you could certainly pull this off for less. I think a month long 3 country tour could be done for $1,200 per person if you go in October, January, February, etc.

  
Ubers were CHEAP! There's no reason to walk anywhere unless you want to, and there's no reason to take a bus unless you're driving an hour or more. We took taxis too and paid cash for those, but the total cost of 17 Uber rides in S.A. was $131. The ride to the airport in Denver was another $54 by itself.

  
Hotels came out to something like $800. We never stayed at the cheapest option and occasionally stayed at some really nice places. We never shared a room or bathroom, we're too old for hostels.

  
All other expenses (food, activities, taxis, souvenirs, etc.) came out to $4,132. We ate at restaurants for EVERY meal, drank a little, bought tons of art, jewelry, trinkets, splurged on a private car over a long bus ride, and overall lived quite well.

  
So the TOTAL COST of 28 days in S.A. was $8,350.

  
Some big expenses to keep in mind: 

\-Entering Bolivia as an American costs $160 per person for VISAs on arrival.

\-Tickets to hike Machu Picchu and the train to get there cost $412 for two ppl, plus we hired a private tour guide.

\-We ate mostly at sit down restaurants and could have spent way less on food.

\-We booked a total of 6 flights and were on 9 different airplanes. We also took a private car once to avoid 4 hours on a bus. We definitely could have saved money with some buses.

\-ATMs in S.A. are some bullshit! I was getting charged $7-$10 in fees for every withdrawal. Luckily, Capital One doesn't charge extra for foreign ATM fees or it would have been even more.

\-My girlfriend must have bought 15 rings and sent 20 postcards (post cards were like $5 each to mail to the States!) and we bought a lot of art and souvenirs.

  
Overall, it was definitely worth it! We cashed in over $2,000 worth of credit card points to offset the trip's cost. Head over to r/churning to learn how to accumulate points quickly or feel free to ask me anything about that.

  
With 2 or 3 new credit cards, a travel buddy, a cheap destination (like South America, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.) some careful planning, flexible travel dates, cheap hotels, and a bit more frugality in your spending, you could definitely do a month abroad for a little as $4,000 out of pocket, even less if you're really roughing it. I don't regret spending just over $8,000 cuz we were quite comfortable most of the time. $10,000 would get you a month of luxury. Happy travels!

  
PS: I highly recommend GuruWalks, they offer free walking tours in many cities all over the world, you just gotta tip. Booking anything at all via trip advisor or anything like it is a total rip off.",,,

I booked a round-trip flight through Booking.com in September, with the ticket clearly stating that it qualifies for a full refund if canceled. The itinerary was as follows:

Outbound (Boston to Kuala Lumpur):
	•	BA202: BOS to LHR
	•	BA33: LHR to KUL

Return (Kuala Lumpur to Boston):
	•	BA34: KUL to LHR

Travel dates:
	•	Outbound: 12/13/2024
	•	Return: 1/3/2025

The flight had a layover at London Heathrow (LHR) in both directions.

I canceled the ticket around November 2024, but despite multiple follow-ups with Booking.com, they keep telling me that the refund is “pending confirmation from the airline” (British Airways). It’s been months now, and I still haven’t received my refund.

Here’s a quick timeline for context:
	•	September: Flight booked.
	•	November: Flight canceled.
	•	December/January: Original flight dates passed.

Booking.com insists it’s the airline’s responsibility, but I believe they should be assisting me more actively in resolving this.

Has anyone faced a similar issue with British Airways or Booking.com? What steps can I take to escalate this or ensure I get my refund? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Basically, we're looking for a wellness resort and I'm having a hard time finding somewhere I like that fits the budget.

Even when I've looked at non-inclusive places to stay that still kinda fit the bill other factors make them not ideal options or just as out of budget: either expensive to fly to from ATL, not walkable to food/activities outside the hotel, or negative recent reviews/questionable quality for the price. Besides the spots I listed in Arizona, the places I've looked into the most are Rio Grande area in Puerto Rico, Ojo Caliente in Santa Fe, Carillon Miami, and Hot Springs North Carolina (still impacted by the hurricane and not quite the vibe anyway).

- Turkey (2 1/2 to 3 weeks since it's a big country to explore)
- Egypt and Jordan ( since it's side by side)
- Georgia and Armenia.

I reached a lot about Georgia and Armenia and to get to a few places it is expensive as you can only go by car or only with tours. It also looks like it's for hiking enthusiasts going from one mountain to the other.

Egypt and Jordan it's sounds reasonable and again it's a lot of tours and for one person its not quite economical. Especially in Jordan.

Turkey:- I haven't dived in depth on this, but it looks like its welcoming solo travellers.

I have seen many people who went on solo travelling. This is my first time. What do you guys suggest I should look for more activities like in Jordan or Egypt or look for solo travellers or cultures in Turkey. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

- 1 night sleeper train to Hanoi [fly to:]
- 1 night Ho Chi Minh 

We like a mix of beach, city, countryside, culture so want to experience it all. Love trains and have researched a lot on sleeper trains so no worries there. Prepared for a packed schedule 😄

1. Is Sapa very busy? We would love a quiet day or two in the countryside exploring, would love to go to Sapa but wondering if there’s a quieter, similar place to visit? 
2. I’d really like to do a couple of luxury (ish) nights near the beach, like an all inclusive hotel with swim up pool and private beach or a serviced villa with a private pool (thinking Bali vibes). I’ve seen some lovely spa type resorts in land but would like to be near a beautiful beach. I thought Ha Long Bay would have somewhere like this but I can’t find anywhere. Upon more research I’m reading that the south is better for beaches so I’m wondering if I should take a night from Ha Long Bay and Hanoi/De Nang and spend it at a beach resort somewhere if anyone has any recommendations? Maybe reachable from HCM or De Nang, or closer to Hanoi that we could get off of the sleeper train early? Not a crazy 5* but around the 200 USD a night mark?
3. Are we missing out by not going to 
Nha Trang or Ninh Binh? Obviously we can’t do it all but see these come up on itineraries a lot! 
3. Is there anywhere good to rent bicycles? Thinking Sapa!

eDreams Prime Subscription refund!,3,1hzkjqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hzkjqj/edreams_prime_subscription_refund/,5,1736680377.0,"Hi all!   
We booked 2 tickets from eDreams (an international flight in Europe) and paid for them with our debit card. They asked for our name and email for the booking process. We paid through our debit card. After some hours they charged our debit card for 90 Euros! I called them and they told us that we are subscribed to the Prime membership!! But we have never had an account on their website or application, we never had an email confirming membership, payment, or invoice, nothing to show us that we bought this or that we are a member now! I called them about this and their story is that 3 years before we purchased 2 tickets on their website (no account created by us or things like that), those tickets had been discounted as a first free discount for Prime members (no email received or confirmation about registering in this membership). Now, after 3 years,  we bought 2 other tickets, and with a discount (as they say), we are automatically part of Prime membership!!! And for that, they took from our debit card 90 Euros!!!!  
This looks so shady, such scum and wrongdoing from them! We have never registered to their website, or app, never clicked on membership things, not received invoices, email confirmations, or anything like that. They got their money and now they don't want to refund them!   
What we did wrong? What can I do to cancel this membership and get my money back? ",,,

Current general itinerary:

US to Rothenburg ob der tauber - spend one day (technically two half days due to travel from the first day)

Rothenburg to Munich- 2 days. Including a 1/2 day trip to Dachau

Munich to Salzburg - 2 days

Salzburg to Fussen- 1 day in Fussen seeing Castles

Fussen to Lucerne - 2 days. Mt Pilatus and city exploring

Lucerne to Zurich (not really spending more than 1/2 day in Zurich, it is more just to fly out of. 

  
I am sold on going to Rothenburg, We don't want to spend a ton of time wandering Museums, we enjoy sigts and more outdoor things like nature as well as good food. My main concern is the amount of time we will spend traveling from spot to spot. Packing and unpacking isn't as much of an issue as we plan to pack light anyway but I do realize travel and checking in and out of these places will eat into our sightseeing. Some of the cities seem very touristy so I am open to alternatives that will still allow us to see some of the major things but maybe have a more authentic feel to them. Considered cutting out Switzerland all together and finding a smaller town still in the Alps. Suggestions welcome. And if it makes more sense to do cities in different order we are open to that as well. ",,,

Bali trip report - two weeks over the holidays,91,1hyu5yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hyu5yb/bali_trip_report_two_weeks_over_the_holidays/,20,1736595696.0,"Hey all - I'd like to share a bit about a trip that my partner and I recently took to Bali. Having gone through a lot of previous posts on this sub and others, Bali does seem fairly polarising so I figured it'd be good to give our perspective after returning.

TRIP SUMMARY

* Mid 30s, black/white gay couple 
* Flew from London
* First time in Indonesia though we’ve been to SEA before
* Decent budget - we splurged on nice villas, beach clubs and fine dining 
* Theme of the trip: food, fun, relaxation

ULUWATU

* Day 1: Transfer to villa from DPS (pre-booked through Klook), settle in
* Day 2: Bingin Beach, lunch at Kelly’s Warung, explore Uluwatu Temple and 6pm Kecak Fire Dance (pre-booked through Klook), dinner at Yuki (one of the highlights)
* Day 3 (Christmas): Day bed at White Rock Beach Club, Melasti Beach, dinner at Mason
* Day 4: Yoga at Alchemy, Padang Padang Beach, lunch at Suki Espresso, Thomas Beach, dinner and drinks at Savaya

UBUD 

* Day 5: Breakfast at Drifter Surf Cafe, transfer from Uluwatu (used private driver), lunch at Bebek Tebasari Resto, checked-in, dinner at This Is Bali, drinks at Bacari (best cocktails we had on the trip)
* Day 6: Walked around central Ubud, Art Market and shops, Monkey Forest, dinner at Locavore NXT (highlight of the trip)
* Day 7: Suwat and Kanto Lampo Waterfalls, warung lunch at Tegalaland Rice Terrace, Ubud Palace, dinner at Merlin’s Magic
* Day 8: Coffee tasting at Intan Sari Plantation, afternoon at Cretya Pool Club, dinner at Room4Dessert

CANGGU

* Day 9 (NYE): Morning transfer from Ubud (used private driver), late lunch at Luigi’s, NYE party at Finns Beach Club
* Day 10: Morning chill at villa, lunch at Pison Cafe, Bodyworks Spa afternoon
* Day 11: Shopping along Batu Bolong, afternoon at the Lawn Beach Club, dinner at Sista Dumpling (very good)
* Day 12: Chill day at villa, gay bar hopping in Seminyak
* Day 13: Morning transfer to DPS for flight to Singapore

HIGHLIGHTS

* The food scene - From local warungs to international restaurants, the breadth of options really blew us away. In particular we like to try different fine dining restaurants when we travel and in Bali we tried a number of restaurants that likely would have a star if the Michelin Guide covered Indonesia. Highlight by far was [Locavore NXT](https://locavorenxt.com/) which was in our top 3 meals of the year. 
* Friendliness - nearly every interaction we had was positive. Having been to many countries with a touting/haggling culture, we came in prepared and felt that locals were friendly without being aggressive about buying or spending money. All of our drivers and villa hosts were especially welcoming and helpful. 
* The ease of booking things last minute and creating bespoke/custom activities was great. In most of Europe/America you have to book excursions days/weeks in advance and typically pick from a package tour. It was great being able to do a private personalised tour with a driver that wasn’t cost prohibitive. 
* Traveling while gay - being a gay couple we’re always very aware of the places we travel to and how we present ourselves. We knew that Bali was generally welcoming but it was still nice to visit a place where we didn’t have to go out our way to hide ourselves. While we limited PDA, we did share beds in every accommodation without issue and had fun in some of the gay bars in Seminyak. 
* Traveling while black - I had no issues whatsoever. In fact, having been to 8 countries in Asia, this was probably the place where I’ve been stared/gawked at the least. It was refreshing. 
* Nightlife/party scene - we love going out but were a bit apprehensive after hearing about bogan culture in Bali. Honestly this felt completely exaggerated. We hit up numerous bars, pubs, beach clubs and had no issues. Perhaps we’re just used to the similar British drinking culture (😅) but everything felt pretty tame - even Finns on NYE!
* VIllas - this was one of our favourite things about Bali. We were able to stay at places that would be 3-4x the cost in Europe or Caribbean. Every place we stayed was great but we especially loved [our place](https://www.archdaily.com/1017680/freebird-residence-alexis-dornier) in Canggu. 

DISLIKES

* Traffic - we had read all about this so while it wasn’t a surprise, it was still really tiresome. The infrastructure of the southern half of the island just doesn’t seem able to cope with the amount of people moving around (and yes we understand that we were part of the problem). It took us over 3hrs to get from Uluwatu to Ubud one day which is 50km/30mi. I honestly don’t know what the solution is but this can’t be sustainable. 
* Trash/pollution - I also had prepared myself for this, particularly in the Kuta to Canggu strip, but it was sad to see rubbish essentially everywhere we went from the beaches to the waterfalls to the rice fields to the walking trails. I’ve been to nearly 50 countries and it’s probably the worst I’ve seen in nature anywhere. 
* Bali belly - again read a TON about this beforehand and thought we were prepared. No ice, only brush teeth with bottled water, trusted/higher rated restaurants, probiotics weeks leading up to the trip, religiously using hand sanitiser and wet wipes before/after touching anything. We each still got sick twice on the two week trip which unfortunately did impact our eating out experience. We became very familiar with charcoal pills and Imodium.

CONSIDERATIONS

* It was rainy season and while it did rain every single day, it was usually only for an hour or two. This wasn’t a deal breaker for us but next time we’d probably prefer to go in the dry season. 
* We only needed cash for waterfall entrance fees and drivers that we arranged ourselves. For everything else we were able to pay by contactless, even the warungs we went to. 
* If you’re doing any fine dining restaurants or day beds at popular beach clubs, book ahead. We missed out on a few places because they were fully booked on the dates we wanted. 
* Bring a dry bag, microfibre towel and water shoes/sandals. These were a must for most of the waterfalls and beaches. 
* We didn’t want to drive a scooter so we used Grab/Gojek daily which was very cheap and efficient. The only issue we had once was in Canggu near Batu Bolong Beach. I called a Grab from outside a hotel and when I was getting on the scooter, we were approached by three aggressive men from the surrounding shops. They intimidated the driver to the point that he kicked me off the Grab (I was literally already on it) and cancelled the ride. The hotel security just stared and did nothing.
* Cost - coming from London pretty much anywhere is cheaper. However when comparing to other SEA countries we’ve been to (Thailand, Vietnam, etc), Bali felt significantly more expensive even comparing to the tourist areas of those countries. The service charge + tax on everything upped the price of everything by 10-15%. 

FINAL THOUGHTS

We went into this trip sticking to the most touristic parts of the island so we definitely understand that our experience reflects that. This was a taster trip for us and we really enjoyed our time here! Would we come back? Definitely! We’d love to check out other areas of the island as well as other places like Lombok and the Gilis. Either way, it was such a fun trip and I can't wait to explore more of Bali and Indonesia!

We're traveling to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur at the end of may and beginning of June. Plane tickets are bought, so this timeframe cannot be changed.

For KL we though on staying 7 nights, and doing one day trip to Cameron Highlands and another to Taman Negara (as we would have gone on a tour even if we stayed there overnight and the drive should be more comfortable on a smaller bus?). Do you think this is a good ideia? 

Regarding beach resorts and relaxation, we read that Langwaki in June gets heavy rainfall (not what we're looking for at all...). So we thought on staying in Bintan Island instead, an Indonesian island, 1 hour ferry ride from Singapore. 
Even though Langwaki looks much prettier and better in general than Bintan Island, we really want to escape the rain and the overcast and cloudy weather. What do you guys think?

Advice for a Solo Traveler Seeking Hiking / Adventure Tourism,0,1hzjs4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hzjs4l/advice_for_a_solo_traveler_seeking_hiking/,4,1736676969.0,"I’m a 32-year-old solo traveler who loves cities but is eager to explore the natural beauty of the world through more adventure and physical activities. I’ve been drawn to places like Albania, Montenegro, and the Dolomites for hiking and outdoor experiences. Back in high school, I was fortunate enough to go on a school trip to Borneo, where we hiked and climbed Mount Kinabalu, and I’d love to recreate that sense of adventure as an adult.

Here’s the thing: I’m a bit daunted by the logistics as a solo traveler with no real experience in planning or safely executing a hike or biking trip. Things like equipment, maps, food, and navigation feel overwhelming, but I’m more than happy to put in the physical effort if I can figure out the rest.

I’ve been looking into guided group tours, which seem like a good option, but they tend to be on the pricier side. Are there more affordable alternatives, like hiring local guides?

I’m also curious about finding organized social hiking groups or ways to connect with like-minded travellers. If you’ve done something similar, how did you go about it?

Any advice or personal experiences you can share—whether it’s about planning, safety, connecting with others, or just great places to consider—would be super helpful!",,,

Has anyone had experience booking a Sundarban tour either in Dhaka or Khulna?

I managed to do this easily in Chitwan, Nepal, but im not finding out as much information online or the tours seem extremely overpriced/im usually a budget traveller.

Visit wolfgangsee in Austria with a toddler in Oct,0,1hzi5xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hzi5xt/visit_wolfgangsee_in_austria_with_a_toddler_in_oct/,2,1736669743.0,"Hi! We are a family of 3 (me husband and a soon-to-be 3 year old toddler). we will be visiting Germany and Austria early October and right now I have 4 nights left to book between staying in Munich and Vienna. I'm thinking of visiting Saltzburg and the lakes nearby with a few potential itineraries. We are not going to rent a car so we rely on public transportation and taxi (if needed but not preferred). 

I'm thinking either A). staying in Saltzburg for four nights and take day trip to Wolfgangsee by public transit, or B). stay there for a night or two.   
  
A). day trip: based on google it takes about 1 hour ish to get there. and I wonder if its doable to hike up to Plombergstein and down, grab lunch, walk along the lake for as long as our toddler is cooperative.   
B). stay there for a night or two and then take train from there to vienna (our next stop).

For either case I would love to hear if anyone has past experience about weather in early Oct there, scenery, any suggestions on activities, lodging and any other ideas. We are also open to bike tours as we bike regularly where we live but we will need to attach a bike trailer for our kid. I'm not sure if its easy to rent bike trailer or other ways that allows us to bike with a toddler. Right now we just have 4 nights to book so we are open to anything.

So I bid on business class for BCN-MAD route and “more leg room” on the flight to NYC ( bus class for 4 would be too expensive for me for MAD-NYC leg).
I was upgraded to business class at $50 per person (min bid) for our first leg. For business upgrade I expected a roomier seat + some food service.

We’re planning a trip to Spain in April 2025 and would love your advice on our itinerary! Does this timeline make sense? Should we spend more time in certain places or cut a city? Is Córdoba a day trip from Seville? How's the weather? 

**About us:** We’re based in the US, in our early 40s, and fit with no health issues. We’re highly motivated to explore, experience, and learn as much as we can. I’ve been to Barcelona, but my better half hasn’t had the chance to visit Spain yet, so this will be her first trip (and around her bday).

We realize there’s so much more to see in Spain, but with limited time, we’ve decided to focus on this region. Madrid and Seville are non-negotiable musts for us.

**Proposed timeline:**

* April 4 (Fri): Land in Madrid (morning). Travel directly to Seville (by car or train).
* April 4–8: Seville (4 nights); day trip to Cordoba.
* April 8–10: Granada (2 nights).
* April 10–13: Travel to Madrid in the morning (April 10) (3 nights); depart April 13 in the morning. 

We plan to come back to Spain in the next 1-2 years to explore other regions, so this isn’t a one-and-done trip!

**Questions for you:**

1. Does this itinerary look reasonable, or do we need more time in certain cities?
2. Should I extend the trip by 1-2 days? 
3. Should we remove a city to make the trip more relaxed? We don't want or like being rushed.

Mexico 2 week itinerary ,5,1hz303s,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hz303s/mexico_2_week_itinerary/,5,1736621933.0,"Hi,

I am planning a two week trip to Mexico. I will be going solo and will be staying in hostels. My current plan is as follows:

CDMX - 6 nights

Puebla - 1 night

Oaxaca - 4 nights

Puerto Esconcido - 3 nights

It would be great to receive any pointers on this plan including the number of days spent at each place. I'm quite a social and active traveller, I like cities with lots of things to do and see and eat but also looking forward to some beach activities and trying to surf etc. and I do enjoy taking part in the nightlife.

Puebla looked like a good option to break up the journey to Oaxaca, however if its better to use that day elsewhere I wouldn't be averse to flying to Oaxaca either (or doing an overnight bus although I've heard this might not be the safest option) so would be keen on opinions on whether its worth stopping there. Also welcome any other tips or insights people may have on the number of days I'm spending at each place (e.g. should I move one of my nights in CDMX or Oaxaca to PE?)

Peru Machu Picchu & Sacred Valley Tour recommendations... for someone who doesn't like tours,1,1hz71g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hz71g3/peru_machu_picchu_sacred_valley_tour/,12,1736632739.0,"My husband and I are at an impass. I love traveling and planning logistics and the adventure of ""figuring out"" local transportation. I want to spend a lot of time at the archaeological sites in and around Cusco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. I want to wander around the neighborhoods and eat street food and try less-touristy, more authentic restaurants. I want the freedom to sit somewhere and draw for 2-3 hours, should the inspiration arise.

On the other hand, my husband wants to book a multi day tour. He said he doesn't want to have to think about anything. He just wants to relax and see the sites.I told him I would do all the research and planning, like I always do and he can just show up and enjoy. He is still insisting we do a tour because he prefers not to have an ""adventure"" vacation.

The problem I have with tours is they cost more, the food they provide generally isn't very authentic, you don't get a lot of time at the sites, you see the same sites that everyone else does and skip the less known ones, and you are on a timeline and always worried at being back at the bus at a certain time.

So with all that being said, has anyone taken a tour of the sacred valley area where they got to see a lot of interesting sites, not feel rushed, at a reasonable price? I'm thinking we can stay in Cusco and do a few self catered day trips, and then hop on a 5-6 day tour to appease my husband's wishes.

We'd be traveling for about 2 weeks in total, flying through Lima and staying mostly in Cusco, Ollantaytambo, and Aguas Calientes. I definitely want to see Pisac, and the sites around Cusco and Ollantaytambo.",,,

This summer, I am planning my third European trip. My cousin and I are taking our grandmother to Paris, it has been her dream for many years. I am looking for advice on a couple of things. My grandmother is in good health, and has decent mobility, but she is still 78 years old. Obviously, we will be taking a slow pace (taking taxis, seeing only a few things a day, etc).

How many days are reasonable for Paris?  We would probably just hit the major highlights, in favor of also having time to enjoy and take it slow.

Also, we would like to go to Versailles. Would we be able to take the train to and from Versailles, and see it well, all in a day? Or is it worth moving and staying in Versailles?

Finally, what would be another good side trip, like a couple of days in another location? We don't need to stay in France, but because of Paris' central location/not wanting to travel lots and lots, I feel like we should. I have looked into Normandy, is that the best choice?

I normally take Korean Air when going home because I like the product (and to maintain my Morning Calm membership) but this trip I will need to stop by shortly in Hong Kong at some point to take care of some personal business as well.

Cathay offers a 1-stop flight from JFK to HKG to ICN at a price point that's $350 less roundtrip than taking Korean Air (this would be a direct flight from JFK to ICN, then a separate flight from ICN to HKG). The layover time will also be long enough for me to do whatever I need to do in Hong Kong. I used to ride Cathay quite a bit 15~20 years ago but it's been too long for me to remember how the seats/service/etc. compare to Korean Air at this point - not to mention things may have changed in the time frame that I haven't taken their flights.

First of all, where is contractless payment available?

Bolivia, Cusco, and Arequipa were all also fine, generally sunny and dry and temperature varied but rarely too cold for me in the day time. Lima meanwhile is cloudy, foggy, dreary and just depressing at this time of year for weeks, if not months, on end. To be frank, I don’t do well with seasonal effective disorder and I’m not a snow or skiing person so those aren’t draws for me either. The cities, culture, food, maybe wineries and haciendas would be more my interests.

To cut to the chase I’m wondering if Santiago, Valparaiso and the surrounding area’s weather at this time are more like Lima, the Andes or Buenos Aires (or neither!) and whether the trip would be worthwhile or better to save for another year when I can go during at a different time. I’ve read and seen mixed things in guide books and online with some mentioning what sounds like a Lima like fog/smog in Chile at certain times of the year but nothing I saw was super specific. I don’t mind 50F/10 C or above and sunny in the daytime, but if it’s consistently much colder than that or overwhelmingly foggy or rainy every single day for months on end I’m not sure it would be the best time for me. I know evenings are cooler than days usually so I don’t mind that.",,,
10 days in Mallorca - where to base? ,1,1hyyh1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hyyh1a/10_days_in_mallorca_where_to_base/,6,1736609923.0,"My husband and I are going to Mallorca this September for 10 full days. I need help deciding where to stay!!! Everything seems beautiful and there are so many good places. 

I was thinking Palma for the night we get in and also the night before we fly out just for ease of travel. 

Maybe soller? Santanyi? But valldemosa and deia seem beautiful also! And Alcudia. Ugh I can’t decide. 

We are in our early 30s, we don’t want to go to party but just to go beach, eat good Spanish food, explore, walk around, soak up the culture. 

We’re either going to do small hotels or a rental. No resort or large hotels. Not our vibe. 

I’ve researched a ton of places but cannot decide which cities to stay in. I’d like to hear peoples opinions who’ve been there and which places they liked most?

Was thinking this : Sept 11 arrived in Palma, stay in Palma overnight and the 12th. 

Sept 13 take tram to soller, stay in soller and port soller 13 - 17. 

Sept 17 leave soller and go to santanyi???? Unless you have another suggestion. I’m kinda between pollenca and santanyi. 

Stay there until the 21 and then get up and go back to Palma on the 21 and stay the night near the airport and leave the 22nd? ",,,

Californa 17-day itinerary feedback,1,1hyxa8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hyxa8x/californa_17day_itinerary_feedback/,4,1736606511.0,"Hello!

We are going to California mid-June (two adults and two children – 8 and 10). We will be there 17 days, travel days included. We fly to and from San Francisco. I'm trying to come up with a good itinerary and would appreciate your feedback.

We are interested in mixing city and nature - with a focus on beautiful views, beautiful nature and fun experiences for the children. We have previously driven around several countries, and the children have no problems with longer car journeys.

Some of the cities/places we are interested in visiting are San Fransico, Muir Woods, Lake Tahoe, Sequoia, Joshua Tree, LA, Monterey, Big Sur and the entire stretch between LA and SF.


This is a rough sketch:

Day 1 – arrive in San Francisco in the evening

Day 2 and 3 – San Francisco

Day 4 – pick up rental car early in the morning and drive to Muir Woods. Then drive on to Lake Tahoe

Day 5 – Lake Tahoe

Day 6 – Drive to Yosemite

Day 7 and 8 – Yosemite

Day 9 and 10 – Sequoia Joshua tree?

Day 11 and 12 – LA

Day 13, 14, 15, and 16 – Monterey, Big Sur, and places between LA and SF (welcome tips on places to visit)

Day 17 – Drive to SFO (flight at 7 PM)

 
What I'm most unsure about is this:

1. Is Lake Tahoe worth it? It will be a four-hour ""detour"" to go there before Yosemite. Should we stay two full days?

2. Should we skip Sequoia and Joshua tree and spend more time elsewhere?

3. How many days do you need in Yosemite? Can just one whole day be enough? Of course, we understand that we won't be able to see everything. Even if the children can walk a bit, they won't be so keen on long hikes.

4. How hard is it to get around in LA? Will the days be mostly spent trying to get from one place to another?

If you have suggestions for other places to visit, please tell us 😊 I don’t think we’ll drive down to SD, though.

Grateful for your feedback!",,,

**DAY 1: MALAGA:** arrival in the early morning, visit of the city.

**DAY 2-3: GRANADA:** two-day visit, considering half a day at Alhambra.

**DAY 4: CORDOBA:** visit of the city, including Mezquita

**DAY 8: GIBRALTAR** (Rock, Cave, Cable-car) and leaving on the afternoon for Ronda to have a night walk around

**DAY 9: RONDA and SETENIL DE LAS BODEGAS**, to then reach Malaga airport on the afternoon.

Another option would be to skip Gibraltar and Malaga visits and add up Cadiz and/or give more time to other places.

Advice on when to visit Rome.,1,1hyrndy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hyrndy/advice_on_when_to_visit_rome/,9,1736584419.0,"Hello everyone!

In July I’m attending the Silverstone GP for Formula 1 and then I heading over to Paris to go to Disneyland there for a day or two. I really love history and I’ve always wanted to visit Rome and I’ve decided I’m going to go this year, I’m just struggling with when to go. I have 3 possible options that I’ve come up with Pros and Cons for and I’d love some advice.

Option 1: I go before the race and Paris. My current travel plan is fly out the 30th of June and head back the 11th of July. If I go before I’d probably fly out the 26th/27th June and then continue with the planned dates. 

Pros: 
1. I’m already on that side of the world.
2. I’d get to go sooner.
3. They cleaned up Italy for the Jubilee so everything with be the cleanest it been in a while (or so I’ve heard)

Cons: 
1. It’s peak tourist season and I’m really boardering on the hot months which I don’t do good in for health reasons.
2. It’s the Jubilee so they’re expecting much more tourists than normal to be there.

Option 2: I go in mid-late January. 

Pros: 
1. It’ll be after the Jubilee.
2. It’ll be colder weather and the typical down season.

Cons: 
1. Italy is hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics in early to late February. Does that mean major monuments, roads and such will be shut down for construction like Paris? 

Option 3: I go November - December this year.

Pros:
1. Colder weather and not peak tourist season (Atleast for America and I avoid like Christmas time)
2. I don’t think they’ll do construction (if they do any) until the end of the Jubilee.

Cons:
1. No real perk or reason to go this time except for the weather. 
2. Still jubilee time with unpredictable tourist influx
3. (Kinda a weird one) My friend/tattoo artist is coming to my state (in August I drove 20 hours to get a tattoo from her) and I really wanna get a few pieces by her and just see her. She’s not sure when she’s coming just that it’s after April. So by going later this year I’m risking missing her.

Am I required to book a hotel or can I stay at the airport during the layover? Does my UK ETA count as a landing card?

And what does a 24 hour stay permit entail? Is it something I apply for now, at the airport or is it assumed to be given? I don't need the 144 hours since the layover will only be 20 hours, for which I'm hoping to not need to leave the airport for.

"Traveling to tokyo in April, possible Issue with my passport",1,1hyl7vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hyl7vr/traveling_to_tokyo_in_april_possible_issue_with/,7,1736560556.0,"Okay so I'm doing a trip to Japan mid-april, going from LAX to HND airport. The thing is, I live in Mexico and I'm planning on taking my flight to Tokyo from Los Angeles, due to me only having an American Passport. There's only one problem: 

while I was setting my documents using the United Airlines app, I noticed that my Travel Agency made my flight reservation using both of my last names (Here in Mexico we use both last names), while my american passport uses only one last name. This issue prevented me from scanning my passport earlier, due to the discrepancy between the name used in the reservation and the name used in my passport. Is this going to prevent me from doing the flight to Tokyo? I can also get a Mexican passport and be done with this Issue but that would bring up another possible issue. Contrary to american passports, Japan does not allow mexicans passports to enter using the passport alone. You need to also get a tourist Visa iirc. Is it going to be an issue if I use a mexican passport in the LAX airport and then use my american passport when I arrive at japan's migration control?

Any help is deeply appreciated. Thx

EDIT: I already found a solution to this Issue. Thanks again for all your replies ❤️",,,

Backpacking Malawi for 10 days - itinerary feedback and other questions,0,1hyqdhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hyqdhc/backpacking_malawi_for_10_days_itinerary_feedback/,7,1736578722.0,"***** I humbly request that you please ONLY COMMENT IF you have experience traveling within Malawi or if you are Malawian and have relevant input to provide. FYI I have plenty of experience travel backpacking and driving in countries with ""difficult"" road conditions and driving behavious. Thank you in advance! *****

-------------------------

Hello all! I hope you are well. I (30M, american but look pakistani) will be backpacking Malawi for around 10 days. My date of arrival will be 15 Jan and leaving 25 Jan. As such, I am sharing my itinerary for your feedback and to see if I should add or subtract anything from the list. I am quite flexible in what I want to do. Of course lots of nature, but also want to enjoy the cultural aspects and visiting cities for experiencing 'way of local life' and 'cultural/unique cities' when I backpack.

FYI I will have a rental car for all of my journey. If any other travellers, or locals, want to join, feel free. I do plan to be 'budget friendly', so lots of couchsurfing (where available) or sleeping in hostels/budget accommodations or even in the car.

Tentative itinerary:

* Lilongwe
* Malanje
    * Malanje Massif (day hiking trail)
* Zomba
* Cape Maclear
* Nkhata Bay
* Livingstonia
    * Chombe plateau (if time)
* Vipya Mountains (if time)

As for other random questions, which provider has the best overall coverage throughout the country? I was wondering if Visa credit cards are widely accepted at places (gas stations, accommodations like campsites, entrance fees for parks, restaurants) or do I have to carry cash? if you are aware of the recent road conditions to any of these places, please let me know. In addition, I heard about there being a gasoline shortage so please comment on that as well.

"Juneyao - Manchester to Phuket - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly",3,1hya3c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hya3c6/juneyao_manchester_to_phuket_the_good_the_bad_the/,3,1736531007.0,"The Good, (The Average), The Bad, (The Really Bad) & The Ugly

A trip from Manchester to Phuket for Christmas & New Year. I always research flights for ages, looking for the best trade off of travel time & cost. Our flights for this trip were coming up at around £1400 each for 3 of us then suddenly Google flights threw up this flight for £749. Juneyao Air, a Chinese low cost carrier expanding to international destinations and resuming flights from Manchester, perfect timing for us.

That's the background, now The Good, The Bad & The Ugly

The Good. 

Price. at £749 per person, we had flights from Manchester via Shanghai with a 4 hour layover outbound and 4.5 hours inbound. This was only slightly longer than via Doha or similar for virtually twice the price. Our return leg between Phuket & Shanghai was greatly improved by the ability to upgrade to business class for £75 each at check in. Not BA level business but a major improvement on economy. 

Lounge Access. In Shanghai Juneyao have a lounge at gate 71 that you can access for around £20 which is well worth it as you also have access to a quiet area with zero gravity beds, however you need to set up Alipay or similar as they only accept that or cash. If your onward flight is delayed you get in for free, something they didn't advertise.

The Average. 

Check-in. Uneventful apart from having to take our cases after checking in to a central drop off point in Manchester Airport. Choice of inflight entertainment is just OK. 

The Bad. 

The food. If you like pork then maybe it's not an issue, but the choice on all our flights was pork & 1 other option. No veggie. 

The website. Trying to navigate online check-in or seat selection was a nightmare. I worked out how to choose the seats a few weeks prior to departure but it is a real faff and not obvious.

The Really Bad. 

Customer service. There is none. I tried to contact them multiple times without response and also tried calling the customer service centre in China, which despite stating it was English, did not understand anything I was asking.

The upgrade auction. Don't waste your time trying to do this if you are trying to bid for more than one of you, it will consume hours of your life that you won't get back. I did a test bid for our Phuket to Shanghai leg, bidding for just myself at a price of £115, was unsuccessful and ended up getting the upgrade at the desk for £75.

The Ugly. 

Legroom. If you take a low cost European airline, knock a few inches off seat pitch and throw in reclining seats and you have a really uncomfortable setup. The international leg wasn't horrendous but the Shanghai to Phuket flight was torture. 4.5 hours of being unable to move with a reclined 12 year old ""Darcy"" in front of me fighting with her brother made that leg unbearable. 

The wine. Just plain undrinkable, vile. A 1 Euro Spanish supermarket carton of wine is infinitely more drinkable than what was served. No beer and only 1 drinks service on an 11 hour flight.

I will be having my first backpacking trip that I plan to start around the end of February this year (almost 2 months from now). I will have about exactly $5000 usd that is NOT including my flight to get there and back home. I will be meeting a friend there in Bangkok and we will probably do the typical banana pancake route (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia) together before we separate as she plans to go to South Korea afterwards Then I will be solo.

After researching, it seems like with $5000 I should be okay with money for the Banana Pancake route however I also really want to go to Bali, Malaysia, Singapore for 1-3 days, and the Philippines. 

Do you guys think this is possible? And if it is would I have to be extremely frugal? Or am I being way too optimistic? In terms of priority, I definitely want to do the Banana Pancake route  + Bali and Malaysia for sure. I am okay with cutting out the Philippines if it wouldn’t really be possible or comfortable.


As for a timeline I am thinking:

3-4 weeks in Thailand

3-4 weeks in Vietnam

2-4 weeks Indonesia 

2-3 weeks Philippines 

1-2 weeks Laos

1 week Cambodia

1 week - 10 days Malaysia

1-3 days Singapore

I also want to note that it is very possible for me to get an extra $1000 (extra $2000 would be a stretch but also somewhat possible) for the trip that would bring me to $6000- $7000. Do you think $6000 would be a comfortable budget if not $5000? 

Also are there any places that you would recommend me staying longer or shorter to make the most of my money? Also what route for all of the said countries would you guys think would save me the most money when it comes to flights? Or also boat transportation? What would be the best route based on my budget?

I guess my question is whether 7 weeks is enough for all of these countries. Since I’ve  already been to Thailand I would only be spending 2 weeks there. Getting my PADI and going to Khao sok and then fly to hcmc and go north for 3 weeks and after that take a plane to Bali Indonesia and stay there for another 2 weeks.

Photos/travel report from recent travel to Sri Lanka,1945,1hx1ddo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hx1ddo,43,1736387205.0,"Towns/cities visited -

Day 1 - Negombo (we only spent the night there as our plane arrived at 11:30 pm)
Day 2-3 - Sigiriya (We went to the Dambulla Cave Temple, Sigiriya Rock, Pidurangala rock, and did an elephant safari at Hurulu Eco Park
Day 4 - Kandy. I had low expectations for Kandy but I ended up liking it! The view of the lake was lovely
Day 5 - Infamous train ride from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya. We arrived around 12:30 pm, and only had enough time to go to Pedro Estate for a tea plantation tour. I heard Damro is better but it’s 45 mins away on a tuktuk.
Day 6-7 - Ella! We saw the Nine Arches Bridge and Little Adam’s Peak. We did a free cooking class at our homestay. 
Day 8-9 - Dikwella (I surfed at Hiriketiya Beach and snorkled at Turtle Point. Saw a turtle, plenty of fish, and nearly stepped on a sea urchin by the rocks)
Day 10-12 - Mirissa (Surfed again at Weligama. It was cheaper and the beach and waves were so much better)
Day 13 - Galle. Rather doing a day tour, we decided to spend the night and it turned out to be a good decision. It was lovely to walk around the fort with fewer tourists and drink some wine at night by the cobbled streets 
Day 14 - Colombo. 

Unexpected moments
While we were in Sigiriya, we stayed in a homestay that was a 10 minute walk from the main street. We were about to go for a walk to get some dinner, when our host stopped us and warned us that it was dangerous to walk outside at night because of the wandering elephants that could maul us. I thought that was pretty crazy. 

Accommodation
We stayed mostly in homestays and i could definitely recommend it as it was probably the best part of our trip. We had our best meals at homestays. The hospitality was on a 5 star level, and yet some homestays cost around $15/night for a clean room with AC, private bathroom and free breakfast. Staying at homestays was an experience by itself and i ended up getting a bit teary eyed as i left one.

Transportation
We travelled mostly by bus (the regular kind, not the newer AC buses). It was cheap but crazy and i have to admit it was harder than i thought. It’s fine as long as you get a seat, but if it’s full and you have to stand the whole ride… boy. 

A lot of sources suggest using PickMe and/or Uber to get around the cities. However I think it only worked in 3 areas for us though (Negombo, Nuwara Eliya and Colombo). I think the cause as to why no drivers will accept a booking (even in touristy towns) is because of the “Tuktuk Mafia”. In Mirissa, we saw a tuktuk driver get beat up by other drivers for picking up tourists using the app. On the flip side, we found some drivers who would take us to our destination for the same price as shown in the app. 

The people
Im from a country whose people are known for their warmth and friendliness towards tourists… but WOW i was blown away by how genuinely kind, curious and friendly the locals that we met were. 

The food
The staple is rice and curry (along with other veggie side dishes). For the rice and curry meal, it was a hit or miss for us, but the best ones we’ve had were either in our homestays or in hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Other Sri Lankan dishes we enjoyed were the cheese and egg kottu, string hoppers (especially the crispy kind), and the rolled appam with sweet coconut inside. 

For protein/meat, restaurants will usually have chicken or seafood. We rarely encountered beef or pork in the menu, even in restaurants with western food. We usually spent around 5,000 rupees for food + drinks for 2 people per meal, and this would be in a mid-more expensive restaurant.

My plan was originally to book all necessary hostels beforehand, so that I wouldn't have to worry about that. However, some of my plans are fairly ambitious, and one late train might mean that I cannot reach my intended destination during that day (I am using a DiscoverEU travel pass, where traveling days are limited).

Also, plans may change on the fly, so I have considered not pre-reserving my accomodation and rather just walk into the hostel and ask them for their cheapest room. My only concern with this is that everything might simply be full when I arrive, and that I can't find an available hostel. That is what I want to ask in this post:

**How full are hostels in Europe usually in May, and how likely am I to find room in a hostel near the city centre/railway station if I don't book in advance?**

If it helps, I am planning to visit the following cities: Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, Venezia, Roma and Napoli.

Looking around areas like Breckenridge,frisco,keystone, etc for this. Some springs would be cool to if possible. Since we're not skiing which area is the best for activities for non skiing. Maybe even some indoor too if we don't want to be outside one day.

Also is it worth booking a rental car or trying to do shuttles. I'm not against shuttles if it allows us to get to a lot to do in the towns.

Vietnam Visa,1,1hy4vkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hy4vkw/vietnam_visa/,4,1736517234.0,"Hi everyone,

I’m a UK citizen currently in Vietnam, I’ve been given the free 45 day visa and my times almost up. Will I be eligible to go to the border, come back in, and be granted another 45 day free visa all in the same day?

Over the past year I’ve travelled around SEA so that will show on my passport that I’m not trying to cheat the system.

I understand I can apply for a E-Visa for 90 days, but I wanted to see if this is a option I can use first. Also in applying for a 90 day e visa you have to be out of the country and wait to be granted the visa. I’m working so it will be harder to go down this route.

If anyone could share some of their wisdom on this topic, that would be greatly appreciated!

Since the airlines will be different, do I just pass through customs/immigrations and claim my checked luggage and then proceed to check in for Korea and drop off checked luggage and pass through security to board flight to South Korea?

Help Me Decide: Ecuador (Round 2) or Colombia for My First Solo Trip?,0,1hy306p,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hy306p/help_me_decide_ecuador_round_2_or_colombia_for_my/,3,1736510917.0,"Hey everyone!

I’m planning my first solo trip and need help deciding between two amazing options: a second visit to Ecuador or diving into Colombia for the first time.

Here’s some background:

* Ecuador: I visited in September with my husband and loved it! We explored the Amazon, spent five days in the Galápagos (Baltra/Santa Cruz landsided with excursions), Mindo, and Cotopaxi. I felt safe, even with the coastal drug crisis (but skipped the coast), and really enjoyed the experience and people. However, I feel like I missed out on some highlights like Baños, Cuenca, and the rest of the Galápagos. I also know someone there now who’s offered to show me around, which makes the idea of returning super appealing plus having been to Ecuador already gives me a good feeling about the country.
* Colombia: It’s been on my bucket list for a while, and I’m eyeing places like Tayrona/El Zaino, Palomino, Cartagena, Islas del Rosario, Valle de Cocora. The idea of exploring Colombia’s vibrant culture, stunning landscapes, and Caribbean coast is so exciting!

A bit about me: I’m 35, fluent in Spanish, and plenty of travel experience in Latin America/am familiar with the culture.

The trip duration would be approx. 18 days (I live Europe, so I want to make the most out of the time)

I’d love your input:

1. How do I decide between revisiting Ecuador or exploring Colombia for the first time?
2. Did I miss any must-see spots in either country that you’d recommend?
3. Any other tips or recommendations?

Thanks so much for your advice! 😊",,,

Verbal abuse by guard at the Greyhound at Dallas,0,1hyhfnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hyhfnn/verbal_abuse_by_guard_at_the_greyhound_at_dallas/,6,1736549642.0,"TLDR; I was insulted, verbally abused, threatened and not allowed to board the greyhound bus at 3:20 AM just for not noticing a sign pointed to where the passenger drop off was and a non-consensual picture of me was taken.



I had booked a round trip and initial bus was scheduled to be at 7:50PM on the 6th of January but the bus got cancelled. The mail contained no information about the cancellation (i.e if it was cancelled one way or of the round trip was affect etc) and it also contained no information about rescheduling. I called the customer care number and I had to wait for 40 mins to finally speak to someone and they helped me reschedule it to a bus for 3:30AM midnight.

I had a friend take me to go to the bus station using google maps and reached at 3:20AM to board the bus. (I had literally just arrived in Dallas the previous day noon and I am completely new to the city.)

I saw the bus and started walking towards it cause it was about 500 ft away and the security there yelled NO, GO AROUND. So I thought I had to go to the other side and get on the bus so I got back in the car and we took a turn and went to the other side of the bus.

The minute I got out of the car the security guard started yelling at me asking if I was dim in the head and why I was not following instructions and then he proceeded to say that I was disrespectful when I had not done or said anything. He continued yelling and verbally abusing me for 3-4 minutes before pointing at board there that said no passenger drop off with an arrow that showed where the passenger should be dropped off. I proceeded to apologize profusely saying that I had not noticed the board and said that I will come in through that way but he said that he wouldn’t let me board. I continued to apologize and requested him to permit me to board the bus and he took a non-consensual picture of me and said that he wouldn’t let me board the bus and ensure that I would not be able to travel from there (on another bus) on that day.

I pleaded and asked multiple times to get on the bus but he didn’t listen and just kept repeating that I can’t board the bus and that I would get a refund for the ticket. I had to leave from there in tears.

This was at 3:20 AM on a freezing night in Dallas downtown which is well known to be unsafe and I am a single 25 year old girl.

There was no reason to treat me that way when I told him that I didn’t see the sign and that it was my first time there cause I am new to the city. Also the presence of a sign there indicates that a lot of people make this mistake. (I have taken a greyhound bus from NY to Boston before and I just had to walk directly to the bus and the pass was scanned before entering which is why I thought it would be the same here.)

I strongly believe the reason he behave this was because of underlying racism and that he had no strong reason to stop me from boarding.

I was honestly pretty shaken up after the whole incident that I did nothing about it. My friends have asked me to post about this on media and try to reach out to them about this which is why I thought I would post this here. I have also been trying to contact the Greyhound phone line to file a complaint and try to get a refund but so far no luck.",,,

# About My Trip:

* I’ll be staying for **3 nights and 4 days**.
* I wish to stay in a hostel, I have always met some wonderful people on my trips in hostels.
* I enjoy exploring local culture, food, and nightlife, so somewhere close to the action would be ideal!

# Specific Questions:

1. **Accommodation Recommendations**: Any hostels, you’ve stayed at and loved?
2. **Meeting People**: What’s the best way to meet locals or fellow travelers in Belgrade? Are there particular bars, events, or activities you’d recommend?
3. **Other Tips**: If you’ve been to Belgrade, any must-dos or hidden gems I should check out?

Also, most likely this should be fine but I have a foreign passport and a UK BRP, if someone could share their experience of recently being held up or troubled for the same then that would be great!

Planning to have some vacations in Central America, maybe Mexico not sure yet.

Just wondering how is it for tourists to fly a drone there?
From what I've read, tourists are allowed to fly any drone below 250g without any prior registration, as I got a Mini 2 I guess that won't be a problem.
Also read that some places are strictly forbidden, eg. archaeological places and that's OK for me, I understand.

The main places I'd like to fly would be some beaches like in Tulum, Playa del Carmen and maybe some cenotes.
Also willing to fly in Holbox, is it OK or not?

Did anyone fly in these places without any issues with the authorities?
Also how is it regarding safety?

****

I feel exhausted picking these out. It seems like every rental car company has so many complaints you read in reviews about how they're looking for any and every excuse to jam you with extra fees. Yes, we all know to top up the tank.

**[rant]** I tried Avis out, thought they'd be a good one, long brand history. No. I return the car to an empty location and pop the key in the drop off well ahead of the scheduled return time. They sneak in a ""late fee"" and never tell me. Never ask anything. Just bill me an extra $16, find out later when I check my CC transactions monthly. No explanation of what I was supposed to do. Nobody present to do anything with (6pm, this wasn't midnight). Customer service, talked to them for 20 days now, just a run-around, they never intend to refund that $16. Basically, they run their business cheaply and charge me extra for it with scams. Customer service is a robot with a preprogrammed 2-day delay. Priceline who I booked with doesn't care, won't use them again. I'm working on a chargeback now. C'est la vie. **[/rant]**

So, the point of this isn't just to rant (thanks for listening), but to know: which brands, if any, aren't scummy like that? I assume the ""cheap"" ones all are like that, you pay *full price* in the end. Maybe I'm wrong.

I'm traveling from **Auckland** to **Kuala Lumpur** with my wife and our active 22-month-old, and I'm trying to figure out the best flight option for us. I have two choices:

**Option 1: Air New Zealand + Separate Airline**

* **Flight 1:** Air NZ Auckland to Singapore (with a Sky Couch)
* **Layover:** 4 hours in Singapore
* **Flight 2:** Scoot, or another airline (separate ticket) from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur
* **Return is the same** (Singapore to Auckland with layover)

**Option 2: Malaysia Airlines (Direct Flight)**

* Auckland to Kuala Lumpur direct (3 seats, no Sky Couch)
* **Slightly cheaper** than Option 1

I’m leaning towards **Option 1** because of the Sky Couch on Air New Zealand (which seems like a life-saver with a toddler), but I’m also wondering if the hassle of the layover, changing airlines, and the added cost of the separate ticket is worth it.

On the other hand, **Option 2** is more straightforward with a direct flight, but I’m concerned about the lack of a Sky Couch and how comfortable it will be for our toddler.

I need advice for traveling to the U.S. as a minor,0,1hxorvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hxorvr/i_need_advice_for_traveling_to_the_us_as_a_minor/,17,1736460700.0,"Hello everyone!

I'm fairly new in this subreddit, and I'm new to travel to other continents. I'm a citizen of Israel, and I live in the Czech Republic (with permanent residency).

I'm planning to visit my long-distance girlfriend on Christmas, however I've never traveled to the U.S. before. I'm 16, turning 17 by the time I'm planning to visit. I have my own job and I believe I can afford a 10-day trip. I'm planning to visit Virginia (specifically land at Dulles Airport), and I am absolutely confused at what in the world are all the documents I need. I'm planning to reach out to the U.S. consulate/embassy later if needed. 

From what I understand I need a tourist visa, letters from both of my parents with their contact info and confirmations that they're giving my girlfriend's family responsibility over me for the duration of my stay, and their signatures. I also know I need the girlfriend's family letter with contacts, and signatures, as well as acknowledgement of responsibility. I am planning to renew my (Israeli) pass this month, and wait until August to apply for the tourist visa. Is there anything else I'd need? (Ofcourse travel insurance, tickets, and money for the stay are included in my plans).

Thank you to everyone for taking their time to read, and if so I thank you for any help! It's appreciated!",,,
"Lost Bag with Ryanair Since October – Claim Marked as ""Closed"" but No Updates or Compensation",8,1hx9f8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hx9f8u/lost_bag_with_ryanair_since_october_claim_marked/,2,1736416271.0,"Hi Reddit,

Back in **October**, my cousin and I flew with Ryanair, and our checked bag decided it had other plans. Fast forward to **January**, and there’s still no sign of it. I filed a claim right after it went missing, hoping for updates, compensation, anything!. Recently, I checked Ryanair’s system, and it says my claim is **""closed.""** Closed?! That’s cool and all, but nobody told me if they actually found my bag or if I’m getting any compensation. Did “closed” mean my bag is officially retired?

I’ve reached out to customer service, and while they’ve been polite, I still have no real answers. At this point, I’m mostly wondering if my bag is living a better life than me.

So here I am, asking the wise folks of Reddit:

1. Has anyone else been in this situation?
2. How do I get some clarity (or closure) on this claim?
3. Should I just accept that my bag has moved on and is now thriving somewhere sunny?

Thanks for any advice—or just commiseration—because at this point, it feels like Ryanair thinks “closed” means “we’re done here,” while I’m still left wondering if my bag is off enjoying a better customer service experience elsewhere.",,,
travel with my wife for 11 months,4,1hxdl9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hxdl9f/travel_with_my_wife_for_11_months/,23,1736431793.0,"Hi fellow Redditors! First time poster, occasional reader. I am looking for advice on the following information.

My wife and I are from Victoria, Australia, 33M 31F. 

Our plan is to travel for roughly 11 months on 60K AUD for two people. We have some travel experience mostly in SEA and New Zealand. It will be our first time traveling further than SEA. As the title says, we are planning at the end of November 2025, to travel for close to a year. our itinerary is as follows: We will be starting in Laos for 3 weeks, then heading to the Philippines for 2 weeks (to celebrate Christmas and new year with my wife’s family). Taiwan around 2 weeks (maybe 3) From Taiwan we at the moment are planning to go straight to Nepal for around 3.5-4 weeks. After Nepal we will head to Egypt for around 3 weeks (is this too long in Egypt? (We do not want to move around too often). Turkey 5-6 weeks. Greece 3 Weeks, Spain 2 weeks, Portugal 4 weeks and possibly Peru (or another European country instead— as Peru is far out of the way and may be better planed another time). 

My main ask is, will 60,000AUD be enough for the propsed countries? Obviously the time listed does not add up to 11 months as this is a basic itinerary we’ve come up with in a few days discussion. the flight to Laos is already booked, but nothing else is booked yet, so the itinerary can be changed. If these countries listed for the time proposed blow out the budget, i may remove 1 or two countries from Europe and maybe stay in SEA for a larger portion at the beginning of our trip. countries visited so far in SEA are: Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia. As we’ve visited a good chunk of SEA + doing Laos at the start of our trip, we were hoping to go to the other places proposed. 

We are usually mid range travellers in SEA and usually spent 100+ per night for our accomodation etc as we like to be moderately comfortable. i understand that this trip will need to be different in terms of our spending habits and we will need to get used to staying in places that may not be as nice as usual. 

In terms of food, i myself aren’t a huge foodie (trying to change), my wife is though, so food expenses most likely wont be a huge excessive part of our budget. since our trip is spread out around the world, we will most likely choose to fly from country to country (unless we can find a safe and cheap alternative). The primary things we like to do is sight seeing e.g. the Pyrimids of Giza, Machu Picchu etc etc, walking around town and soaking in the atmosphere, eating at resturaunts (we avoid street food— heard too many horror stories about it and the last thing i want to do is be sick on this amazing trip, or at least avoid it as much as i can. So this will add to our cost). We like to do activities in countries where available e.g. hot air ballooning, ziplining etc etc in Laos. Island hoping e.g. in Greece. Nile boat tour in Egypt etc. you get the picture! We like to see multiple parts of a country and not only stay in one areas for our stay. 

has anyone had experience in the last year in any of these countries? I’m not looking for ultra cheap like backpackers do, but definitely a change from our normal spending habits were necessary.

sorry if i haven’t got a more detailed itinerary to work with. But I hope people can offer me a reasonable outlook on what our funds could get us for the time in the listed places. Even if someone honestly says that our 60K would last us for the countries proposed for the time listed, that would help me work around what to do going forward and try extend the trip for 11 months. 

Please dont hesitate to ask and get me to clarify any questions you may have to help with your response!

Thailand vs Philippines for 2 Week Trip End of December/Early Jan?,1,1hxlyfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hxlyfk/thailand_vs_philippines_for_2_week_trip_end_of/,15,1736453414.0,"Hi, my boyfriend and I (both 26) are planning to travel to SE Asia for 2 weeks at the end of the year from Dec 19-Jan 5. We were initially thinking about doing Thailand (Bangkok, Phra Nga Bay/Phi Phi Islands, Koh Samui) but then started seeing some videos of the Philippines (El Nido, Coron, Boracay to be specific) where the beaches look even better (we are huge beach lovers)! 

This will be our first time traveling around SE Asia together (been doing trips around Europe in past years) but we are avid beach goers (love sandy beaches, snorkeling), enjoy boat tours and are huge foodies. We also enjoy checking out cocktail bars, sunset drinks and some party/going out scene, which is why we were thinking Thailand in the first place; though after watching some videos about Boracay/El Nido, those areas seem to have better beaches, as well as options for nice boat tours as well and cute cafes/bar scene. For more context for this trip, in Thailand initially, we were also hoping to find a 5\* resort stay since it's relatively cheaper and do activities like cooking classes, jet skiing, yoga, etc. It'd be helpful if anyone has an opinion if Thailand or Philippines would be better suited for us given our interests and what we wanted out of our trip? Over the past few summers, we've really enjoyed island stays (in particular Milos, Sicily, Ibiza, Mallorca) that have that island-y vibe, but aren't too big but still lots to do around. 

I've also been seeing videos about the weather/rain in both of those regions around this time - does anyone know if one of these regions tends to be more rainy at the end of December? I know Koh Samui can be rainy as it's wet season is ending and we would do that last if we went to Thailand.

I've been doing a lot of research and I would like to be somewhere warm so Italy, Greece, Mediterranean area seems like the best option in Europe. 

Leaving in late May to flight to Athens, spend a day there, then take a ferry to Mykonos and stay for 3 nights, take a ferry back to Athens and spend 2 more days there to explore. Then, taking a train to Patras (Greece) and then a ferry which stops in Corfu and ultimately gets us to Bari, Italy. This is where I'm a bit unsure of plans...

We have about 6 nights in between London and Paris to fill and were planning on spending it down in the south of France on the French Riviera. Looking for advice on where to go for this part of our trip.

Looking for these 6 nights to be a bit of a break from the big cities of London and Paris. Both of us like to kind of settle when we travel and not be overly busy or running around. Will be hiring a car in this region to do little day trips but nothing too excessive.

I love the idea of being in a small little town, with not much to do but wander, eat, read and write. My partner enjoys this but is also looking for something a bit more, with some sort of night life that we could tap into if we wanted, bars and restaurants etc. So hoping to find the best of both these worlds!

Options that we have been looking at so far are:

* Moustiers-Sainte-Marie
* St-Paul-De-Vence
* La Ciotat

Considered driving up to San Francisco but then I’d be driving through the fire - are roads even open? Is this a viable option??

TL;DR – travelling to South and Central America for 9 months with partner, is GBP£20k per person enough (incl. flights)

Me and my partner are planning on travelling to South and Central America (from the UK) towards the end of the year for 9 months and are looking for a sense check on our budget as currently seeing an awful lot of variances in what people deem an appropriate amount (especially with the high levels of inflation over the past few years).

To provide an idea of the type of travellers we are, we are big into our hiking and as such anticipate spending quite a large amount of time in Chile/Argentina, we will be taking our camping stuff so will be mostly self-sufficient when it comes to being in nature and camping is allowed. We anticipate we’ll be primarily using public transport where available and only flying between countries where necessary (Peru to Argentina, Chile to Ecuador and Colombia to Costa Rica). As well as hiking we are both into our nature so spending a bit of money on activities like diving and guided tours is expected.

We’re currently in the process of putting together a rough plan of the specific areas we’d like to travel to within each of the countries below, from our initial look I’ve estimated the number of weeks we’re likely to spend in each country. In terms of how we’ll travel it’ll be as logical as possible to minimise duplicating legs of travel (although realise in some cases this is not possible due to local infrastructure)

Brazilian side of Iguazu Falls to Argentinian hotel,2,1hx5vbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hx5vbs/brazilian_side_of_iguazu_falls_to_argentinian/,5,1736400828.0,"We are landing on the Brazil side of Iguazu and plan on catching the bus straight to the Brazilian side of the falls. I heard there is somewhere to store your luggage?

From there I’d like to get a taxi to take us through customs and over to our hotel on the Argentinian side.

Will there be taxis waiting or do we need to book one? Approximately how much would I expect to pay for the trip?

I want something gorgeous and relaxing, but a place that wont bore them to tears, but gives them plenty to do. One wanted a place with a hut over the water. lol. Of course a nice bar, but no Spring Break type resort or island. I paid my dues there!  I love Turks and Caicos, but not sure that fits them. Open to any suggestion! Thank you!!",,,

What's your travel philosophy and why do you travel? Some personal thoughts after moving abroad,29,1hwjk0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hwjk0e/whats_your_travel_philosophy_and_why_do_you/,38,1736340807.0,"Wanted to share a bit of reflection as somebody who splits their time between two countries and travels from each to all the others, and see if anybody can relate or share other interesting perspective? I always love the reflection that comes at the most unexpected times during and after a trip.  

My answer to my own question: Travel has always been about connection for me—both outwardly and inwardly. Living in Canada and the Middle East shaped this perspective in ways I couldn’t have imagined.

In Canada, the wide-open spaces, diverse cultures, and strong emphasis on individuality taught me to embrace freedom and exploration. It’s a place where you can lose yourself in nature one day and engage in a multicultural festival the next. The connection to the land is deeply rooted in moments of stillness—like hearing only your breath in the Rockies or sharing stories around a campfire.

The Middle East, on the other hand, introduced me to a richness of culture that thrives on community and hospitality. Living in Oman, I see how traditions are honoured and shared with pride. The sense of connection here is deeply personal, from the warmth of a stranger offering coffee to the collective celebrations of religious and cultural events. It’s a place where every corner has history, and every interaction feels intentional.

These contrasting experiences taught me that connection comes in many forms—whether it’s the introspection of a solitary hike in Canada or the shared laughter over dates and kahwa in Oman. They also helped me embrace duality: appreciating luxury and simplicity, solitude and community, adventure and rest.

When I travel now, I look for ways to blend these lessons. I seek the stories that only locals can share, the moments that force me to slow down and reflect, and the places where I can rediscover myself in the unfamiliar. For me, travel isn’t just about seeing the world—it’s about understanding how I fit into it.",,,
Day in Cape Town,5,1hwwcva,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hwwcva/day_in_cape_town/,5,1736373910.0,"Hi there

I have a weeks work in Cape Town but I have one day off and I had a few questions.

I arrive in Cape Town at 7.40am where I have rented a car. I have a Robben Island tour booked for 11am. I am staying in Stellenbosch so dont want to go there first, want to drive straight from the airport to the Waterfront.

  
Is there somewhere secure I can leave the car with all my luggage in the Waterfront?

I should get back to Cape Town at 1pm.

Id then like to go to Camps Bay for lunch, is it safe to walk/run the coast from the Waterfront to Camps Bay alone?

If I went to Camps Bay, it is ok to leave your belongings on the beach for a few minutes while you swim? Any good quiet swimming spots on the walk from Waterfront to Camps Bay.

Any restuarant recommendations in Camps Bay for lunch?

  
Regards

Northern Italy in Late June/Early July,3,1hwyi1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hwyi1c/northern_italy_in_late_juneearly_july/,12,1736379223.0,"I'm looking to schedule a trip to Northern italy with my wife and 2 kids 14yo & 11yo. We're thinking Northern Italy won't be quite as busy/hot as Roman or Tuscany? Let me know if I'm wrong here. 

For the trip, I'm looking to fly in/out of Milan June 26(arrive 27th) - July 12. That gives 15 days, I think 🤔. Anyways, if I was considering the Lake como area, but I'm not sure what town or really where to stay, if someone has a suggestion. Maybe staying here for 5- 6 days. 

From here I'm looking for suggestions. I have a few ideas, like Verona, Parma, maybe even Florence, but likely hot and busy. I'd like to find a base for another 6 days, then finish in Milan for ~3 days since we fly out of there. 

Fitting 4 destinations in might be possible if we move more frequently, but I've found that you just lose so much time running around trying to see EVERYTHING, it kinda takes away from walking off the beaten path days where the magic usually is. Maybe some day trips can be made from our bases instead. 

Anyways, am I crazy to skip Rome for the kids on their 1st trip to Europe? Wife and I have been, and while it's great to see, it's sooo crowded, and definitely, the heat will be a factor. Does this trip sound nice being none of us have been to Northern italy? My wife and I truly loved Tuscan, but im not sure the kids will and kinda looking for places that won't be 100 deg. 

Any suggestions, im open to. Unfortunately, wife's a teacher and summer is vacation time.

Thanks for any input!",,,
Itinerary Thoughts - Bologna + London - April 2025,3,1hwyd6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hwyd6z/itinerary_thoughts_bologna_london_april_2025/,4,1736378903.0,"Hi All - I will be traveling solo with my daughter (7) in mid April 2025. We plan to split our time between Bologna, Italy and London, England. I know Bologna is kind of a random place, but she is named after this area (we were pregnant with her when visiting and didn't have a name).  She's the perfect age to enjoy seeing her name everywhere and she loves the food from this area.  We are also both big soccer/football fans and I think she is at a great place to enjoy the charm of London and all the ""princess stuff"" (her words). This will be my second time to both locations.

Please let me know if you'd change anything in this itinerary. We are considering adding the Harry Potter studio tour, but she's only passively watched the movies and I think she'd be more frustrated that she can't climb on things that look climbable. We are also considering the Natural History Museum, but we frequent similar museums in NYC and DC so it might not be that exciting to her - will keep it in the backpack if weather calls for indoor activity.

I expect the first half of the trip to be more relaxing with a focus on yummy food and the second will be more packed-in.

**Train to JFK (Amtrak + Local Train) Fly to MXP**

* Day 1 / Saturday: Land in MXP then Train to Bologna, acclimate , fun dinner, wander around
* Day 2 / Sunday:  Bologna Cooking Class, explore city, relax

**Rent Car in Bologna (will not drive through ZLT)**

* Day 3 / Monday:  Drive to Modena for Parmigiano and Balsamic vinager tours, hang out in Modena
* Day 4 / Tuesday:  Drive to Ferrari museum and Parma ham tour

**Fly from Bologna to LHR (land \~2PM)**

* Day 5 / Wednesday:  London Eye, wander around, West End Show
* Day 6 / Thursday:  Spurs Stadium Tour /  Tower of London / Tower Bridge / Borough Market
* Day 7 / Friday:  Windsor Castle or Hampton Court
* Day 8 / Saturday:  Football match, West End Show (depending on football match time)
* Day 9 / Sunday:  Football Game (if local game gets flexed to Sunday), Chelsea Tour (if not a match day) , not sure what else if no London games are flexed.
* Day 10 / Monday:  Fly home from LHR

My fiancé just landed with a broken baggage and was wondering which airlines they should file the claim. They booked on Qatars Airways. The first flight was with Qatars but the rest were with American Airlines. Which airlines should be taking responsibility? I'm guessing they would have to file at the baggage claim counter/office and get the case number/file reference number for it then go online to file a claim directly with the airlines. But we are not sure which one. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Since my first flight was domestic, I didn't go through customs, and I didn't exit the airport when I arrived in Mexico City because I was an idiot. Now, I want to go back to Mexico, but I'm worried they won't let me come back in. For reference, I have my entry stamp to Mexico, not my exit stamp.

I’m looking for reccos on where to go/what to do on my Free Days! And any reccos on where best to fit them in!

On my radar to do on free days (that aren’t already on either of my 2 tour itineraries):
* Killarney (seems viable)
* Limerick (seems viable)
* Dingle (seems viable)
* Glendalough/Wicklow (seems viable)
* Waterford (viable?)
* Sligo (viable?)
* Donegal (I don’t think viable? given my itinerary)
* Londonderry (I don’t think viable? given my itinerary)

Where else am I missing? 
Any suggestions on if these places are worth trying to get to?

Also, I won’t have a car! I would consider renting one, but I have epilepsy so I will be relying on various modes of public transportation.

Panama with young kids,5,1hwsdvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hwsdvn/panama_with_young_kids/,2,1736363968.0,"My husband and I and our 2 kids (almost 2 and 4) are planning a trip to Panama in March for 17 days. We have a few days in Panama City before we rent a car to Anton Valley and beyond. We want to take a day trip to Soberania National Park and Gatun Lake to do some hiking, see some wildlife and possibly a boat tour as well. As I'm looking at tours, they seem way more expensive than I originally thought. Is this something we could do on our own without paying hundreds (minus the boat tour of course)? If not, are the tours worth the money? 

We already are planning to hike in Anton Valley and probably near Volcan. Obviously not strenuous hikes, but we will have hiking backpacks for the kids. Should we stick with the Metropolitan park in PC instead of Soberania? Open to options and appreciate any feedback! ",,,
