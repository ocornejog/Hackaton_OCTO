"Colombia's Eje Cafetero and Bogotá -- the perfect trip, until it wasn't",75,1i38v19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i38v19/colombias_eje_cafetero_and_bogotá_the_perfect/,14,1737089799.0,"*TLDR - I fell in love with this country and its amazing people. On my last day I witnessed a shooting and did my best to stop the guy from bleeding out.*

I've been in Colombia for 18 days now. It's my first ever trip to this beautiful country and for the past few days I've been thinking about writing up all my wonderful experiences and sharing them here on Reddit, but something happened today and I'm going to share my unvarnished experience.

I decided to fly to Colombia at the last minute and bought my flights two days before departure. I found a lot of travel inspiration in this subreddit and others that made me decide that the Eje Cafetero was the trip I needed. But the flight deal I found took me to Bogotá.

I spent about a week in Bogotá and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The city was never high on my list, but I wanted to make the most of it. Of course, I was aware of the safety situation in the city, so I took many precautions: Planned my route if I was walking and mostly knew it by heart, Ubered at night, always kept my head on a swivel, all that kind of No Des Papaya stuff.

I spent my first few nights in a hotel near Parque El Virrey. It's a quiet area with plenty of good restaurants and places to walk to. I especially enjoyed my morning walks in the park and along the greenbelt that connects to Parque El Chicó. I had some great meals. And I liked the happening bar scene in Zona T / Zona Rosa.

Then I stayed a few nights at a wonderful Airbnb in Chapinero where the host cooked me a delicious lunch every day. My favorite was ajiaco. I rode the TransMilenio to La Candelaria. Great museums there. And I enjoyed wandering through all the streets and alleys around Plazoleta Chorro de Quevedo. I went to Monserrate and walked all the way up and down. I had a blast stopping at different vendors along the way for fresh fruit, chicha, coca tea. Anyways, you get it: the oft-maligned city of Bogotá has some nice things to offer and I was into it.

But the core of the trip was the Eje Cafetero. So I left Bogotá and I spent 10 days touring Jardín, Jericó, Filandia, and Salento. This is when I really fell in love with Colombia. The people were some of the warmest and most genuine that I've encountered in my travels. I would greet people as I walked around town and it would often turn into a short conversation. I met people that I wound up sharing meals with or hanging out with for an extended time. The landscapes are breathtaking. And also you can let your guard down a little in these areas. Generally, MUCH MUCH safer than a big city like Bogotá. I felt relaxed, tranquil and grateful to be visiting. Maybe one day I will write more about this part of the journey, but you get it: it's an awesome place and I was in travel heaven.

But all good things must come to an end and I arrived back in Bogotá in preparation for my flight home tomorrow. So, today was my last full day in Colombia. Just before 2pm in the afternoon I was walking in one of my favorite parts of Chapinero (east of Carrera 7 and north of Calle 53). An area with amazing restaurants, beautiful homes. . .basically a place that most people would call a ""nice"" neighborhood, and maybe even a ""safe"" neighborhood. 

I saw 2 guys on a motorbike coming my way. A common sight, but one that always puts me on high alert when I'm in Latin America. They passed by me and I kept on my way. And then POP POP POP. It didn't register as gunfire right away, but I spun around and I see the guy from the back of the motorbike with a gun in his hand and the guy he shot crumpling to the ground. By this point, I was in shock/disbelief but a woman near me started screaming and we both went over to the victim to help. I had my suitcase with me and took out a tshirt and applied pressure to the wound on his arm and in his midsection where he was bleeding out pretty fast. A big crowd amassed and after not too long an ambulance and a bunch of cops on motorcycles showed up. I have since read several news articles about the shooting and watched an interview with the victim's mother. He was very seriously injured and is in intensive care. While looking at media coverage I also saw myself on security camera footage that captured the shooting. It was all very disturbing and surreal since I've never had an experience like this. I do realize that violence happens all over the world and this is not just a Bogotá thing or a Colombia thing, but it's cast a shadow over this trip. In addition to feeling sad for the man who was shot I am sad that the many great people who live in Bogotá are dealing with this kind of insecurity. I read some of their posts on twitter and other places online reacting to this shooting and I can sense their immense frustration and anger with their leaders."
What country/culture ended up being way different than you anticipated?,10,1i3f8cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i3f8cp/what_countryculture_ended_up_being_way_different/,13,1737116802.0,"Just thinking back on how amazing my Poland trip was this past summer, and how much different the people were than I had anticipated. You always hear about the Polish face or how there’s little to no emotion, even my Polish friends here in the states joke about it. I also read a lot of history and it’s no secret that Poland has had a rough past… I imagined the Polish people were going to be a sort of hardened, stand offish type people. Like it was going to be hard to connect with anyone. Not unfriendly, maybe just… more hardened than other places in Europe. I honestly couldn’t have been more wrong. I met some of the most delightful people there, everyone I spoke to was extremely friendly and polite. It was the first place I ever had people get excited that I knew a few words of their language, which to hear about happening but I’d never experienced until Poland. I’d honestly say that the Polish are probably some of my favorite people in Europe.



Have you guys ever been totally off base with what you thought a country was going to be like when you got there?"
Why is overland travel to French Guiana so expensive?,158,1i2ump9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2ump9/why_is_overland_travel_to_french_guiana_so/,45,1737049533.0,"I am traveling to Suriname next month and I was looking into a short tour (3 days or so) to French Guiana. I noticed that all tour operators charge VERY high prices just for transportation alone, about USD300 for a single trip from Paramaribo to Cayenne. What is the reason for this? Is it because it is the only option, as there are no flights? For comparison: a single trip from Paramaribo to Georgetown (Guyana), which is roughly the same distance, costs about USD75."
"4 days in Beautiful Baku, Azerbaijan ",2798,1i2bhm8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2bhm8,97,1736985039.0,"This is my first post in the community and I’m relatively new to Reddit. 

I wanted to share some pictures from my trip to Baku from last year. I live in the US and Azerbaijan is not really on anyone’s travel radar and I like to go to off the beaten path places if I can to avoid overtourism. 

In order these are the pictures: 
1. Baku City Seaside National Park - I stayed in a hotel along the park and while on a busy road I loved the park, lots of cafes places to sit beautifully landscaped with nice views of the skyline and the Caspian Sea. 
2. Buildings along the waterfront.
3. Historic buildings in the city center. 
4. Nizami street Baku’s main shopping street downtown. 
5. Same as above. 
6. Museum of Azerbaijan literature. Didn’t go in but did do the national carpet museum which is located in the waterfront park and it was excellent if you like the art of rugs from this region. 
7. Ismailiyya Palace / İsmailliyyə sarayı
8. Səadət Sarayı - used for weddings 
9. Baku City Hall
9. Baku Metro - Photography is prohibited but I was excited to be on a former Soviet metro system so I had to break the rules. 
10 - 11. Baku White City - a new massive development built as an extension of the urban core with modern and traditional architectural styles on former industrial land. The metro will be extend through the area. It has many shops, hotels, offices, and schools mixed in with the higher density housing. 
12. Port Baku, major shopping and office area. Lots of new investments are being made in the area in terms of parks and new streets to be more pedestrian friendly and enhance connectivity. 
13. Taken from Maiden Tower which is not pictured but this is the view of the old city with Flame Towers in the background. 
14. Heydar Aliyev Culture Center by Zaha Hadid. 
15. City view and park in front of Heydar Aliyev Center. 
16. Bibi Heyat Mosque 
17. Gobustan petroglyphs historic site. It was cool to see how this Neolithic society caught water and engraved carvings depicting their rituals into the rocks here and the view was great. 
18. Mud volcanoes. You can touch them as they erupt cold. They smell like gasoline and you can light them on fire. We drove out to them in old Soviet cars which was really unique. 
20. Shah Mosque in the historic city içerişehir. 

Overall I loved Baku it was very beautiful and clean, I wish I could have post more pictures and included the food I ate which was all very fresh and delicious. The city is a great contrast between new and old and it’s hard to place as it looks oddly Parisian or British in parts and then kind of like a Turkic Dubai in other areas. Everyone we encountered was very kind and it was one of the most warm countries I’ve visited. Flying over Azerbaijan the landscape in general is beautiful in the foothills of the Caucasus and would be worth exploring in depth if only I had more time. 

Happy to answer any questions about the trip but thanks for taking the time to view my post. "

6 days in NZ South Island: your advice,4,1i39nui,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i39nui/6_days_in_nz_south_island_your_advice/,10,1737092747.0,"Finally was able to secure trip with family (kids) to NZ. We will arrive/leave off AKL but taking flights to/from Queenstown. We will have full 6 days not including days of travel even days of flying from/to ZQN/AKL.

I am renting a car and my family got used to road trips.

First night will sleep Queenstown > spend 1-2 days in Te Anau/Milford Sound, 1 day Wanaka, 1-2 days in Fox Glacier/West Coast then 1-2 days in Tekapo before heading back to Queenstown and sleep the night before flying out on the 7th day from ZQN to AKL.

I am really not sure if I have skip Te Anau/Milford Sound or skip Tekapo instead. Just a disclaimer, we drove 6-7 hours multiple days in a row on roadtrip before with no issues. We are people of scenes and landscapes, not into beach and not planning to use a chopper.

Please let me know if this plan sounds reasonable or you recommend some modifications by removing some stuff or suggest alternatives

"A very underexplored region! Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan",84,1i2pcmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2pcmr/a_very_underexplored_region_nakhchivan_azerbaijan/,23,1737035497.0,"Recently I visted Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan), the biggest landlocked exclave in the world!



Always wanted to visit it, as it seems to be on no-ones radar. Over the course of my 3 day trip I saw almost no tourists; a single family and one group of friends. The reason for it being that Nakhchivan has few connections to the outside, as the land borders are closed for nearly everyone and the airport mainly serves the capital.

The main highlight for sure is Alinja Castle (Qasili), high up in this mountainous region. And you can feel the the influences of the Middle East and the late Soviet Union, though very few speak Russian (and English even less so).

In general mid-to-cheap prices, but very little tourist infrastructure (that makes exploring it fun though). People are stoic but open to chat if you are able to communicate.

"Asked to a wedding in Sydney, Austrailia in November 2025, also want to go to New Zealand if I am in the area. ",2,1i3cxq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i3cxq0/asked_to_a_wedding_in_sydney_austrailia_in/,11,1737107421.0,"I have no idea where to even start. I have 3 weeks of vacation and I can start on November 12th and end on December 2nd to have some time off before I return to work. Or I can take time off later in November and return mid December. This would mean going to Austrailia first then NZ, and fly home from NZ which is looking like a 3-4 leg journey. Starting point being Edmonton International. 

The wedding is the last weekend of November. 

Based on my research so far it would be better to go to New Zealand first for 1.5 weeks, try to do a stay on both islands, then fly to Sydney for the wedding and a 1.5 week stay. (The less Jet Lag method).

I will have friends in Sydney but NZ will most likely be totally solo, which is fine. Im a LOTR nerd and ive wanted to go for a very very long time.

Flight prices are kind of crazy, initial research is around 3600 CAD one way for premium, (im 6'8"" so I need the legroom), which is almost as much as I spent for a round trip flight to Italy in October 2023.

Any insight or general reccomendations for  planning this monstrosity are much appreciated. Im mostly curious on how I should plan this trip, I can fill an itinerary out later."

Somewhere that has some restaurants / bars nearby so we can just go half board or breakfast only at the hotel. All inclusive doesn’t seem to be much of a thing!

I lived in a hostel beside Seongsan Ilchulbong. But I had no idea about that when I booked it. That night when I decided where to go I realized it was a famous attraction. So I decided to go. Early in the morning when the sky was still dark and black, I went out. The street was empty. However, when I approached Ilchulbong, people in different countries showed up from all directions. It was a moving scenario. I was alone. It was cold. But I was happy to see this beautiful sunrise. Moreover, I also met the foreign couple who took the same bus with me the day before. They hugged when they saw the sunrise. Sweet.

Will be visiting Lisbon/Porto etc. but out inward and outward flights are from Faro, so we'd like to have a few days at either end in the Algarve. 

I'm wondering which is the best place to base ourselves? The aim is mainly relaxation. What I'm looking for is:

- Some decent accomodation, a balcony with a sea view and a pool would be great
- Amenities within walking distance. Grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, bars etc. We're in our 40s and not going to party. We don't need specific 'foreigner' bars or anything and we'd choose safe and (relatively) quiet over loud and exciting 
- Easy to get around on foot or by public transport- direct links to Faro airport are preferred (we won't have a car).

I'm not sure if this is possible or not, but basically I'm looking for somewhere where for a few days we can chill out, stroll around some pleasant streets, relax on a balcony, have enough budget-friendly food options to either buy from supermarkets and have in the hotel or in local cafes, have a nice stroll in the evening and have a nightcap somewhere.

Recommendations of which of the three cities are better, or even specific areas in the city or even specific hotel recommendations are very much welcomed!

What do you think of my (M24) literary for 4 weeks in Europe, May 2025? 
First trip to Europe! It will be a solo trip to celebrate my graduation from uni (finishing my degree!). 

Some things I’m looking for:
- Love architecture, good food, good city vibes, walkable, and soon nature. 
- Budget-friendly is preferred but a good experience is worth every dime. 
- Don’t want it to feel too rushed. For my last destination, I want to relax and kick my feet up for a bit before going back home to reality lol, hence the 6 days. 

How does this look? Any recommendations? 

I would love to explore Italy but I know it will be extremely busy this year (2025) with the Catholic celebration and a bit of a hassle to get to since it’s on a peninsula. Also, I feel like there is so much to see in Italy, so it can be a trip of its own in the future.

Based on my experience, the first two cities that come to mind are San Francisco and Barcelona. In SF, it's very easy for tourists to go from popular places like Union Square, Civic Center, and Chinatown into areas like the Tenderloin, which has become an infamous neighbourhood in the city for all the wrong reasons. And in Barcelona, it's very easy for tourists to go from touristy zones like Montjuic, Poble-Sec, and La Rambla/Gothic Quarter and then unknowingly entering into El Raval which isn't exactly the nicest area in the city by any means.

On the flip side, cities like London, Paris and NYC are generally very safe for tourists as the sketchy zones in those three cities are often located in the outskirts of the city and very far away from the crowded tourist spots, hence making it pretty much impossible for an unsuspecting tourist to accidentally end up there.

What are some other cities you've been to where this is the case? I think this would be good to know for all tourists alike who are looking to visit new cities they aren't familiar with"

I’m a male solo traveler in my mid-20s, exploring North India in March & April, traveling by train and bus. My itinerary for March includes exploring Rajasthan and Utter Pradesh, ending in Vanerasi.

In Apri I will explore Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the order likely being Rishikesh > (maybe Shimla) > Manali > Dharamasala & Mcleod Ganj > Amritsar before a finishing in New Delhi. 

I’d like to do a 4-6 day mountain trek in Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh with the following criteria:

Most important is that the trek includes spectacular, breathtaking views with clear views of some huge mountains and crystal blue lakes.
Moderate difficulty
Availability for tours with food and tents provided, and the option to store my extra belongings at the base. 
Rhododendron blooms in April would be a bonus, but mountain views are my priority. 

From my research Spiti Valley, Kheerganga, Triund, Kedarkantha, and Har Ki Dun all could be options but would love to hear any advice anyone else has!

I’d also like to ask if there are any skiing areas in Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh that are still suitable in April, given it’s the end of the ski season? I love skiing and would be cool to do some on this trip if possible. Would Solang Valley or Auli work for me in April?

We plan to go from Frankfurt to Amsterdam, then to Belgium (Bruges and Ghent), Berlin, and back to Frankfurt to catch our return flight.

Despite the tips to use trains, buses, or flights between cities, we intend to rent a car. Since we are four people, we believe that driving will make locomotion easier, more convenient for carrying our baggage, and maybe cheap. Additionally, we would like to stop in some cities during our road trip without being restricted by fixed arrival or departure times at the locations we plan to visit.

Given this information, is renting a car in Germany to travel to these other countries a good idea? For someone like me, who is accustomed to driving frequently in big cities in South America, is the driving experience in Europe similar? I understand there are some differences, but I’m already reading up on them.

Initially, I was considering renting an EV because I read that some places have low-emission zones, and I was unsure if a regular ICE (internal combustion engine) car would be allowed in these areas. However, after doing some research, I came across people recommending an ICE car for long-distance travel. They mentioned it might be more practical, especially since I’ve never used an EV before, and figuring out how to use charging stations could be challenging.  
Lastly, for someone who has never driven in Europe, considering the parking rules in each country, is it better to try parking in legal street spaces near points of interest in cities, or should I go directly to a paid parking lot?

  
Thank you very much for all the help."

We booked our flights in and out of the country, a hotel for the first night we arrived, and a 4x4 rental for the rest of the trip.

We had a map with everything we'd like to see, and we just went with the flow. Our first stop was based on the weather on that first day. At the end of the day, about 4pm, we opened up a couple of booking apps, searched for locations within a short drive, and booked somewhere on the spot. If we liked a place we'd speak to the owners and ask to extend a night, and one time we left an area earlier than planned as we didn't vibe with it.

We're both from Europe, and we have lots of experience driving abroad. Whether it's crazy European cities like Athens or Tbilisi, or countries like Georgia where in the countryside you're lucky if there's tarmac. [This](https://i.imgur.com/IbqZWAR.jpeg) was our vehicle, and [this](https://i.imgur.com/XYayqL5.jpeg) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/LRmS2ZE.jpeg) are the type of roads we spent some time driving on. **My point being**, we are comfortable in both crazy traffic and in adverse driving conditions. In Georgia we drove the long way back from Ushguli, avoiding rerouting via Mestia; slow, arduous, offroad mountain trails.

We'd like to repeat the freedom this type of experience gave us, but this time in Colombia. 

We have flights into Medellin, and about 2 weeks later flights out of Bogota.

One option is to either use buses to travel between small towns and villages, exploring the countryside and coffee country, with most things prebooked based on public transport schedules, or to go with the flow with a rental car.

A couple of times over the last few weeks I've opened up the booking apps, searched for accommodation near a random village in the region we'll be in, and always found plenty of options.

Does anyone have experience with this? How did you find it? Is this a good idea? How likely are we to find accommodation on the day?"

I've been wanting to do a Working Holiday to either New Zealand or Australia for the last year. Planning on finally going forward with it and hoping to be abroad by August 2025 for around a year. In the middle of saving and planning for it!

I'm F/26, just looking for some general advice, personal stories, or tips and tricks (if any). I'm thinking about using SWAP, but it's pricey, so also wondering about doing it on my own.

**Does anyone have experience using SWAP, and did you find it useful? Pros or Cons?**

I find myself a bit worried that they recommend waiting until you arrive to both job hunt and find accommodation. My one other experience going abroad was doing an internship in South Africa, and my work and accommodation were figured out before I arrived.

What about the 8-Day or 4-Day Welcome Week? Is this worth it? The extra travelling? What about the access to the Whatsapp Group? Did this make it easier to connect with people? I am on the shyer side, meaning the prospect of having these things in place sounds like an advantage. But then again, I'm sure I will meet people anyway through work etc.

**Working Holiday on your own: Pros and Cons?**

The biggest pro is, of course, saving on cash. But did you find it made things more rewarding, more difficult? I went through a third party when doing an internship in South Africa, and there were times when I regretted it and wished I had gone out on my own.

**New Zealand or Australia?**

I know this comes down to preference at the end of the day, but just looking for insight anyway. I'm drawn to both places, though admittedly, Australia has been top of the list until just recently. I have people I can connect with in both places once I arrive too.

What is the job atmosphere like in both places? I have a Bachelor's degree in the arts, and my ideal would be to be hired on by a non-profit. But essentially, I am willing to find work doing whatever (barista, tourism, working with animals, etc. literally anything!)

What are the costs like? Living expenses? Is it easy to travel within the country?

Together with my wife we're planning our vacation in the US. As our experience is non existent if it comes to this part of the world, I would highly appreciate any feedback, suggestion and any other tips which could be useful for us. 
The main goal for the trip is the  ""desert"" nature and national parks on the West Coast. 
Below is our very preliminary plan. 
If it comes to duration it will be min. 10 and max. 14 days, late April or early May depending on the flights schedule. 

We'll be travelling from Europe to LA. We plan to rent a car for a whole stay, something which will be relatively economical and comfortable enough for longer drives (RAV4 or similar?). 
 
We will stay a few days in LA to see some touristy spots and then move to Palm Springs (or somewhere nearby) to visit Joshua Tree National Park. From there, we will drive to Arizona. The main goal is to visit the Grand Canyon. We though about staying somewhere near Sedona and take day trips to Grand Canyon and nearby areas. After a few days, we will move to the south, visit Grand Canyon West and stay couple of days in Las Vegas, again doing some touristy activities. After that, the plan is to go back to LA via the Death Valley National and maybe visit Sequoia National Forest. Probably staying somewhere overnight (or even longer if it's worth it). Then, back to LA for another 1-2 nights and flight back to Europe.

So, that's a very preliminary plan, now a few questions.
1) First of all, is this doable? as per google maps, it will be around 1500 miles in total. Is it possible to do it comfortably or should we consider reducing/changing the plan?
2) Car rental. I have no experience in renting cars in the US. Firstly, I heard that only credit cards are accepted for the deposit even if I paid in advance, is this correct? Secondly, what about the insurance while travelling across different states? In my case that would be California, Arizona and Nevada. I would expect to have FDW which includes thefts as well. Is this a standard coverage in the US? Lastly, could you recommend any car rental companies? Heard some good words about AVIS in LA.
3) Safety in general. Despite ""difficult"" neighborhoods/districts in LA and LV should we expect any problems while travelling? What to look out for, what to avoid? Those long desert roads seem to be a little overwhelming. Also, we're not party animals and like to be in bed around 10 pm so definitely no late partying and travelling for us...

That would be it for now, if you have any locations/areas to visit or places to stay I would grateful for any recommendations. Thanks!"
vietnam e visa,1,1i2yne9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2yne9/vietnam_e_visa/,3,1737059727.0,"Hello every one i just a question regarding visas when travelling to Vietnam. I am a canadian citizen (also a philippine passport holder) and had travelled to vietnam last november. When i went to vietnam on november of 2024 i used my canadian passport with my visa. I was able to go in. I spent 1 week in HCM then travelled to philippines where i stayed for two weeks before going back to vietnam. While in the philippines i picked up my philippine passport. I am a dual citizen of Canada and Philippines. So after being in philippines i went back to travel to HCM. I used my canadian passport along with my visa but the customs agent didnt let me through. Little did i know that my visa was only a single entry visa. I did not know this since it was my vietnamese friend who signed me up for it when we travelled to vietnam the first time i was there. I was lucky i had my philippine passport with me. I showed the customs agent and he gave me an entry stamp and let me go into vietnam. Now on february 2025 i am going back to vietnam. I plan to go in with my philippine passport. I know that with philippine passport you dont need a visa to get in and they allow you with 21 days of stay. This time around ill be spending about 10 days in HCM then go to philippines with my vietnamese girlfriend.(lives in vietnam) In philippines we will be spending about two weeks there travelling around and going to the nice beaches of the country. After all that we will go back to vietnam. My question is that when i travel to vietnam visa free.... then once i exit the country between the allowed duration of stay in vietnam. Then come back into vietnam using the philippine passport i have will the 21 days renew? Basically ill be doing multiple entry with in 6 weeks duration.  
Everytime i exit vietnam i get the exit stamp on my passport. Since i dont need a visa to get in with my philippine passport..  when re entering does it renew the 21 days? Or would i still need to but a multiple entry visa?  
  
Also i already  bought my ticket going to vietnam (using my philippine passport/different last name as my canadian passport). I dont have a ticket yet leaving vietnam... since my stay there would vary regarding on when i leave vietnam with my gf to go to philippines.. i plan to buy it when i get to asia(currently in canada)  
When coming in with the philippine passport would the customs agent  ask for a ticket exiting vietnam? They didnt ask me for a ticket exiting vietnam when the first time i got there with canadian passport/visa. The second time i went there when i bought the tickets i used my canadian passport for the ticket... they didnt ask for ticket going out..   
  
Please let me know the answer thanks"
Finding a guide for Aswan & Luxor in Egypt,1,1i2wn9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2wn9w/finding_a_guide_for_aswan_luxor_in_egypt/,3,1737054609.0,"Our (wife and I) last minute tour in Egypt just fell through.  We will fly to Egypt anyway and, I think, do the route largely as envisaged: Cairo 3 days; Aswan 2-3 days; Luxor 2-3 days.  

I’d be happy to pay for a guide to translate, to run interference in Luxor and Aswan and to educate us.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to find an English speaking guide based in either Aswan or Luxor?"
Visiting Piemonte and Torino,1,1i2wk77,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2wk77/visiting_piemonte_and_torino/,0,1737054389.0,"Hello,
Hoping for a fellow traveller advice.
Caught cheap tickets to Torino and want a little help planing my trip. Just bought the ticket and the flight is on saturday morning so not alot of time to do proper research, since Im working tomorrow lol
I will be staying in Piemonte for 4 days. Im not big on cities and enjoy nature and small cozy towns. However I cant do long hikes (10-15km is a max for now depending on conditions) the time being because of busted knee. 
So far I planned attending Juventus - Milan game on saturday and staying in Torino for the night.
Rented a car for the next days and planning to go to Susa (maybe visiting Sacra de Saint Michele abd Avigliana on the way), spend the night and morning in Susa and drive for Aosta maybe stoping in Ivrea. How does that sound for you?
My concern is whether I picked something that will have that cozy town/nature experience in winter? And any nice places to eat in those towns with simple but authentic food? 
 Will have one day left so maybe I will stay in Torino or somewhere, any advice?(the flight is next day early morning)
Thank you in advance !"

France Suggestions for Itinerary ,1,1i2vpqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2vpqj/france_suggestions_for_itinerary/,2,1737052242.0,"I'm going to be going on my first trip to France in early July, and I have a couple questions and am also looking for suggestions on our methods of travel. We won't have any mobility issues, so I don't think we will be too bothered by the travel. Still curious on folks' thoughts though. I do think we have a train preference because of the comfort. I'd greatly appreciate your thoughts on the questions below.

1. Do you think this is the right order? With Paris as the start and end point, strangely it seems like this order, rather than Paris-Bordeaux-Cassis-Chamonix-Paris, is faster.   
2. Which option for Provence to Chamonix do you think makes the most sense?   
3. Despite not having children or mobility issues, do you think this is too much travel? If so, I'm wondering if the move would be to cut out Chamonix, which I would be really disappointed to do.   
4. What actually prompted me to post is finding out that what I thought was the perfect chateau in Bordeaux only has 2 (and not the necessary 3 we need) rooms with air conditioning and 1 without. This made me want to see if I could re-order things to accommodate the availability of that small chateau. Curious if folks have thoughts on whether no AC in July in Bordeaux is a deal-breaker.   
5. Would any short flights make sense? Looking at the math, it seems unlikely. 

Thanks!

AVOID Transfeero at all cost!,0,1i2uy6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2uy6d/avoid_transfeero_at_all_cost/,2,1737050334.0,"I recently used Transfeero to book a car to take my daughter from JFK to NYC. The driver was not there when we agreed; he then kept saying he would be there in 5 minutes for over 40 minutes while my daughter was waiting.

As she was a minor, the booking was made especially so he could wait for her with a sign at the arrivals exit. Instead, he insisted that she come up to arrivals and get out of the terminal so he could pick her up.

At that point, I did not feel safe having my daughter wait any longer, and I asked her to take a yellow taxi.  


No, Transfeero is refusing to refund me for the pre-paid. 

NEVER USE TRANSFEERO"
Feedback on 3 Weeks in Mexico Itinerary,1,1i2ukv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2ukv9/feedback_on_3_weeks_in_mexico_itinerary/,2,1737049404.0,"Hi there - my partner and I are planning to visit Mexico in the month of March. We will be there for 20 days, which hopefully gives us enough time to explore variety of things from culture, cities, surfing, and plus a tiny diving trip. This is our high-level itinerary so far:

**Days 1-5: Mexico City**

**Days 6-9: San Cristóbal de las Casas**

* We heard we can also do climbing/bouldering here?

**Days 10-13: Oaxaca City**	

**Days 14-17: Puerto Escondido**

* Including day trips to dive at Puerto Ángel

**Days 19/20: Back to Mexico City**

This is decent right? Leaving some room for little bit of improvisation.

My partner is actually staying longer for 5 weeks instead of the 3 weeks-ish. And he's into all of the outdoor stuffs, surfing, diving, climbing, hiking etc. So please do give some recommendations for him!

Cheers!"

So I applied for a visa, only to find out after getting an appointment that I can’t apply for a tourist Schengen visa, while on a short term visa in the Uk, I need to apply in the embassy in a country that I’m a resident of. 

This obviously sucks! And I’ve been planning this trip for almost two years, I’m from Kenya so I can’t really skip school for two weeks to go home to do my appointments. Plus the flight is ridiculous expensive.  

I’m wondering if I should just go for my appointments even though the embassy said they only serve Uk residents?

If I could go home is there a way to expedite the process?

Has anyone gone through this, or a similar situation. How did it work out?

Should I just give up😭

I would love to learn more about what he did, Hong Kong under Japanese occupation, what the battle was like, etc... Not just museums but also actual sites where the military life & battles would have taken place.

I've already visited the HK Museum of Coastal Defence, and I've done some hiking where I could see the pillboxes, trenches, etc... But I'd like to see more.

Are there any museums or places anyone can recommend?  
Are there any institutions/tour operators/etc... who might have tours specialized in such a specific period of HK history?

Paris tour options (4-5 hours max) vs self tour on 10 hour layover at CDG,1,1i2rtmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i2rtmk/paris_tour_options_45_hours_max_vs_self_tour_on/,13,1737042385.0,"My husband and I are flying to Stockholm via CDG in March. We have a 10 hour layover at CDG. We booked this long layover on purpose hoping to give ourselves time to see at least the highlights in Paris. We are flying in on air france in business (also business class to Stockholm). We are traveling with 2 checked bags, which I assume will be checked through to Stockholm for us since it's all on the same ticket. We will have 2 backpacks (small) with us that we can just take with us into Paris on our tour. We'll be arriving on a Saturday morning into CDG.

Currently, we have a private tour booked with pickup at the airport but it's quite expensive. We're fine keeping that, but I was looking for other options. How hard is it to get from CDG to the heart of Paris by public transit/train if you've never done it before. We are pretty good at following directions, of course, but we don't speak French and we want to make sure we're back at the airport in plenty of time for our next flight. We'd like to just hit the highlights. Notre Dame, Eiffel, etc. 

I guess my question is how easy it is to navigate to the city and around the city and then back to the airport without a guide and see things on our own. We're relatively tech savvy, but with time being of the essence, we don't want to make a mistake that would cause us to miss our next flight. I'd love to be able to save that $400 for other activities in Sweden, but not at the expense of adding a ton of stress to our layover. Thanks!"

I am 20 years old and have struggled to find somewhere where I can look to rent a car in this area for 2 days or so. I understand there may be some more options on the ground rather than online, but I cannot seem to find anywhere that will provide me an estimate so that I can work out a budget. In addition, does anyone know if any of the rental agencies in this area will rent a car to a 20-year old? Any help would be appreciated, thank you."

We were assigned different seats what we purchased and when we addressed the issue, the stewardess simply told us to apply online for a refund. Their customer service was very dismissive, bluntly insisting that since we had been assigned seats, we should be grateful, or they would just brush me off completely. I have never encountered a situation where I purchased an additional service that was not fulfilled, and they failed to acknowledge it or issue a refund. 

We spent a total of $80 to reserve two specific seats, which were not provided; this has never happened to me in my travels before. Filling out their online forms was a huge waste of time, and after all that effort, receiving such dismissive customer service was very upsetting."
